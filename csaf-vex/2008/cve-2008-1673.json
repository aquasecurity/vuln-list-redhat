However, this is only a security issue if the SLOB or SLUB memory allocators were used (introduced in Linux kernel versions 2.6.16 and 2.6.22, respectively). All Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Enterprise MRG kernels use the SLAB memory allocator, which in this case, cannot be exploited to allow arbitrary code execution. As a preventive measure, the underlying bug was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5, via the advisories RHSA-2008:0973, RHSA-2008:0508, and RHSA-2008:0519, respectively.",
