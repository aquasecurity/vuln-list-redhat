          "text": "A local privilege escalation vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local, low-privileged user to cause the Juniper DHCP daemon (jdhcpd) process to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS), or execute arbitrary commands as root. Continued processing of malicious input will repeatedly crash the system and sustain the Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Systems are only vulnerable if jdhcpd is running, which can be confirmed via the 'show system processes' command.
