          "text": "Pydantic is a data validation and settings management using Python type hinting. In affected versions passing either `'infinity'`, `'inf'` or `float('inf')` (or their negatives) to `datetime` or `date` fields causes validation to run forever with 100% CPU usage (on one CPU). Pydantic has been patched with fixes available in the following versions: v1.8.2, v1.7.4, v1.6.2. All these versions are available on pypi(https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/#history), and will be available on conda-forge(https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pydantic) soon. See the changelog(https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) for details. If you absolutely can't upgrade, you can work around this risk using a validator(https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/validators/) to catch these values. This is not an ideal solution (in particular you'll need a slightly different function for datetimes), instead of a hack like this you should upgrade pydantic. If you are not using v1.8.x, v1.7.x or v1.6.x and are unable to upgrade to a fixed version of pydantic, please create an issue at https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues requesting a back-port, and we will endeavour to release a patch for earlier versions of pydantic.",
