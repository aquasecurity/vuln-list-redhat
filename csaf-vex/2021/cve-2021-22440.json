          "text": "There is a path traversal vulnerability in some Huawei products. The vulnerability is due to that the software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly validate the pathname. Successful exploit could allow the attacker to access a location that is outside of the restricted directory by a crafted filename. Affected product versions include:HUAWEI Mate 20 9.0.0.195(C01E195R2P1), 9.1.0.139(C00E133R3P1);HUAWEI Mate 20 Pro 9.0.0.187(C432E10R1P16), 9.0.0.188(C185E10R2P1), 9.0.0.245(C10E10R2P1), 9.0.0.266(C432E10R1P16), 9.0.0.267(C636E10R2P1), 9.0.0.268(C635E12R1P16), 9.0.0.278(C185E10R2P1); Hima-L29C 9.0.0.105(C10E9R1P16), 9.0.0.105(C185E9R1P16), 9.0.0.105(C636E9R1P16); Laya-AL00EP 9.1.0.139(C786E133R3P1); OxfordS-AN00A 10.1.0.223(C00E210R5P1); Tony-AL00B 9.1.0.257(C00E222R2P1).",
