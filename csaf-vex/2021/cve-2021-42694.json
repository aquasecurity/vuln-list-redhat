Homoglyphs are different Unicode characters that, to the naked eye, look the same.  An attacker could use homoglyphs to deceive a human reviewer by creating a malicious patch containing functions that look similar to standard library functions, such as print, but replace one character with a homoglyph. This function can then be defined in an upstream dependency to launch source code-related attacks.",

While homoglyph-based attacks can deceive human reviewers, the impact is limited to cases where the code is not adequately reviewed or where automated tools fail to detect suspicious Unicode characters. Unlike higher-severity vulnerabilities, which may allow direct exploitation of system resources or escalation of privileges, this issue primarily targets code readability and review processes. \n\nAdditionally, it is important to note that this vulnerability does not affect Red Hat products, as it arises from the broader issue of Unicode handling in development environments rather than a flaw in Red Hat's implementations.",
