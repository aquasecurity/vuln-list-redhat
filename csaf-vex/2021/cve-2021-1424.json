An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specifically malformed IKEv2 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ipsecmgr process to restart, which would disrupt ongoing IKE negotiations and result in a temporary DoS condition.Cisco\u0026nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
