          "text": "A vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki Z Series devices could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition in the Cisco AnyConnect service on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid VPN user credentials on the affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists because a variable is not initialized when an SSL VPN session is established. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying crafted attributes while establishing an SSL VPN session with an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to restart, resulting in the failure of the established SSL VPN sessions and forcing remote users to initiate a new VPN connection and reauthenticate. A sustained attack could prevent new SSL VPN connections from being established.\r\n\r Note: When the attack traffic stops, the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server recovers without manual intervention.",
