Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\n\n\nThis issue only affects systems configured in\n      either of two ways:\n\n    \n    \n        *  systems with BGP traceoptions enabled\n\n        *  systems with BGP family traffic-engineering (BGP-LS)\n          configured\n\n\n and can be exploited from a directly connected and configured BGP peer. \n\nThis issue affects iBGP and eBGP \n\nwith \n\nany address family\n\n configured, and both IPv4 and IPv6 are affected by this vulnerability.\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJunos OS: \n\n\n\n  *  \n\nfrom 21.4 before 21.4R3-S9, \n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5, \n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S4, \n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5, \n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3, \n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R1-S2, 24.2R2; \n\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved: \n\n\n\n  *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S9-EVO, \n  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S5-EVO, \n  *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S4-EVO, \n  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S5-EVO, \n  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S3-EVO, \n  *  from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-S2-EVO, \n  *  from 24.2-EVO before 24.2R1-S2-EVO, 24.2R2-EVO.\n\n\nThis issue does not affect versions of Junos OS prior to 21.3R1.\n\n\nThis issue does not affect versions of Junos OS Evolved prior to 21.3R1-EVO.\n\n\n\nThis is a similar, but different vulnerability than the issue reported as CVE-2024-39516.",
