The issue leads to a memory leak that cannot be recovered without restarting the application, ultimately resulting in an OutOfMemoryError  and complete service failure.\n\nIn a production environment, this vulnerability poses a significant risk to availability, especially for applications handling multiple concurrent requests. Since no mitigation exists, all applications using quarkus-resteasy are affected until patched. The ease of exploitation, lack of required privileges, and high impact on service uptime justify the high severity rating.",
