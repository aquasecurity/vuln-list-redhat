The vulnerability is due to a processing error in the role-based access control (RBAC) of URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending API commands via HTTP to a particular URL without prior authentication. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform any actions in Cisco Prime Home with administrator privileges. This vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Home versions from 6.3.0.0 to the first fixed release 6.5.0.1. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
