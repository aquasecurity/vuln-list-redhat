          "text": "Vulnerability in the Oracle Identity Manager Connector component of Oracle Fusion Middleware (subcomponent: Microsoft Active Directory). The supported version that is affected is 9.1.1.5.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Oracle Identity Manager Connector executes to compromise Oracle Identity Manager Connector. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Identity Manager Connector, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Oracle Identity Manager Connector accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle Identity Manager Connector.
