The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protection by the Device Manager web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to submit arbitrary requests to an affected device via the Device Manager web interface and with the privileges of the user. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc88811.",
