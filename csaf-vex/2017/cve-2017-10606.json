The TPM is used in the SRX300 Series to encrypt sensitive configuration data. While other products also ship with a TPM, no other products or platforms are affected by this vulnerability. Customers can confirm the version of TPM firmware via the 'show security tpm status' command. This issue was discovered by an external security researcher. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.",
