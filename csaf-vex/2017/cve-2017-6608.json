          "text": "A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) code of Cisco ASA Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system. The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of crafted SSL or TLS packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted packet to the affected system. Note: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects systems configured in routed and transparent firewall mode and in single or multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. A valid SSL or TLS session is needed to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software running on the following products: Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall, Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls, Cisco ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers, Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv), Cisco Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module, Cisco ISA 3000 Industrial Security Appliance.
