          "text": "On Junos OS devices with SNMP enabled, a network based attacker with unfiltered access to the RE can cause the Junos OS snmpd daemon to crash and restart by sending a crafted SNMP packet. Repeated crashes of the snmpd daemon can result in a partial denial of service condition. Additionally, it may be possible to craft a malicious SNMP packet in a way that can result in remote code execution. SNMP is disabled in Junos OS by default. Junos OS devices with SNMP disabled are not affected by this issue. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.  NOTE: This is a different issue than Cisco CVE-2017-6736, CVE-2017-6737, and CVE-2017-6738. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.1X46 prior to 12.1X46-D67; 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D51, 12.3X48-D55; 13.3 prior to 13.3R10-S2; 14.1 prior to 14.1R2-S10, 14.1R8-S4, 14.1R9; 14.1X50 prior to 14.1X50-D185; 14.1X53 prior to 14.1X53-D122, 14.1X53-D44, 14.1X53-D50; 14.2 prior to 14.2R4-S9, 14.2R7-S7, 14.2R8; 15.1 prior to 15.1F2-S18, 15.1F6-S7, 15.1R4-S8, 15.1R5-S5, 15.1R6-S1, 15.1R7; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D100, 15.1X49-D110; 15.1X53 prior to 15.1X53-D231, 15.1X53-D47, 15.1X53-D48, 15.1X53-D57, 15.1X53-D64, 15.1X53-D70; 16.1 prior to 16.1R3-S4, 16.1R4-S3, 16.1R4-S4, 16.1R5; 16.2 prior to 16.2R2, 16.2R3; 17.1 prior to 17.1R1-S3, 17.1R2, 17.1R3; 17.2 prior to 17.2R1-S1, 17.2R2; 17.2X75 prior to 17.2X75-D30.
