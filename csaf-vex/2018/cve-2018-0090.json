          "text": "A vulnerability in management interface access control list (ACL) configuration of Cisco NX-OS System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured ACLs on the management interface. This could allow traffic to be forwarded to the NX-OS CPU for processing, leading to high CPU utilization and a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a bad code fix in the 7.3.2 code train that could allow traffic to the management interface to be misclassified and not match the proper configured ACLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to the management interface. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the configured management interface ACLs and impact the CPU of the targeted device, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products running Cisco NX-OS System Software: Multilayer Director Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Switches, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode.
