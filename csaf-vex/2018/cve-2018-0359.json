The vulnerability exists because the affected application does not assign a new session identifier to a user session when a user authenticates to the application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a hijacked session identifier to connect to the application through the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to hijack an authenticated user's browser session. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvi23787.",
