Further crafted packets may be able to sustain the denial of service condition. Score: 6.5 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) Further, if the attacker is authenticated on the target device receiving and processing the malicious LLDP packet, while receiving the crafted packets, the attacker may be able to perform command or arbitrary code injection over the target device thereby elevating their permissions and privileges, and taking control of the device. Score: 7.8 HIGH (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) An unauthenticated network-based attacker able to send a maliciously crafted LLDP packet to one or more local segments, via LLDP proxy / tunneling agents or other LLDP through Layer 3 deployments, through one or more local segment broadcasts, may be able to cause multiple Junos devices to enter an improper boundary check condition allowing a memory corruption to occur, leading to multiple distributed Denials of Services. These Denials of Services attacks may have cascading Denials of Services to adjacent connected devices, impacts network devices, servers, workstations, etc. Further crafted packets may be able to sustain these Denials of Services conditions.
