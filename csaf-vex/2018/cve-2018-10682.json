It is possible for an attacker to access the administration panel on TCP port 9990 without any authentication using \"anonymous\" access that is automatically created. Once logged in, a misconfiguration present by default (auto-deployment) permits an anonymous user to deploy a malicious .war file, leading to remote code execution. NOTE: the vendor indicates that anonymous access is not available in the default installation; however, it remains optional because there are several use cases for it, including development environments and network architectures that have a proxy server for access control to the WildFly server",

The default installation are by default secured which means that management interfaces are set to have an authentication mechanism. Even without security on the management interfaces there are other approaches that could be taken, as an example a proxy fronting the server could be taking over the configuration.  A second one could be the application server is running on an isolated device that does not allow network connections to it so only a local trusted process can communicate with it. Our default out of the box security considers that the server could be installed on a multi-user server so other users could inadvertently gain access if we had no security.  However in many cases the server will be installed on a single user workstation for developer use, in that case being able to switch off security is desirable so the admin console can be accessed without the need for user accounts. As we switch to the Elytron configuration it is also possible for an administrator to define anonymous authentication policies even if sasl-authentication-factory is not referenced. HTTP remains the same, it is either on or off, a user could however still implement a custom anonymous mechanism.",
