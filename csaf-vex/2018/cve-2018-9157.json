The upload web page doesn't verify the file type, and an attacker can upload a webshell by making a fileUpload.shtml request for a custom .shtml file, which is interpreted by the Apache HTTP Server mod_include module with \"\u003c!--#exec cmd=\" support. The file needs to include a specific string to meet the internal system architecture. After the webshell upload, an attacker can use the webshell to perform remote code execution such as running a system command (ls, ping, cat /etc/passwd, etc.). NOTE: the vendor reportedly indicates that this is an intended feature or functionality",
