The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious TLS message to an interface enabled for Secure Layer Socket (SSL) services on an affected device. Messages using SSL Version 3 (SSLv3) or SSL Version 2 (SSLv2) cannot be be used to exploit this vulnerability. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer underflow, triggering a crash on an affected device. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FTD Software that is running on the following Cisco products: Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv), Firepower Threat Defense Virtual (FTDv), Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliance. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve18902, CSCve34335, CSCve38446.",
