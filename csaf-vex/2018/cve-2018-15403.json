The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the parameters of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting an HTTP request that causes the web interface to redirect a request to a specific malicious URL. This type of vulnerability is known as an open redirect attack and is used in phishing attacks that get users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.",
