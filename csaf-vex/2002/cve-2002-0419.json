NOTE: this entry originally contained a vector (1) in which the server reveals whether it supports Basic or NTLM authentication through 401 Access Denied error messages.  CVE has REJECTED this vector; it is not a vulnerability because the information is already available through legitimate use, since authentication cannot proceed without specifying a scheme that is supported by both the client and the server.",
