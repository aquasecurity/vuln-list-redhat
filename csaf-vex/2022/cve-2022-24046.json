Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the anacapd daemon. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer underflow before writing to memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-15828.",
