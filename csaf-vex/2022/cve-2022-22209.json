          "text": "A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the kernel of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated network based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). On all Junos platforms, the Kernel Routing Table (KRT) queue can get stuck due to a memory leak triggered by interface flaps or route churn leading to RIB and PFEs getting out of sync. The memory leak causes RTNEXTHOP/route and next-hop memory pressure issue and the KRT queue will eventually get stuck with the error- 'ENOMEM -- Cannot allocate memory'. The out-of-sync state between RIB and FIB can be seen with the \"show route\" and \"show route forwarding-table\" command. This issue will lead to failures for adding new routes. The KRT queue status can be checked using the CLI command \"show krt queue\": user@host \u003e show krt state High-priority add queue: 1 queued ADD nhtype Router index 0 (31212) error 'ENOMEM -- Cannot allocate memory' kqp '0x8ad5e40' The following messages will be observed in /var/log/messages, which indicate high memory for routes/nexthops: host rpd[16279]: RPD_RT_HWM_NOTICE: New RIB highwatermark for routes: 266 [2022-03-04 05:06:07] host rpd[16279]: RPD_KRT_Q_RETRIES: nexthop ADD: Cannot allocate memory host rpd[16279]: RPD_KRT_Q_RETRIES: nexthop ADD: Cannot allocate memory host kernel: rts_veto_net_delayed_unref_limit: Route/nexthop memory is severe pressure.
