          "text": "The package snyk before 1.1064.0 are vulnerable to Code Injection when analyzing a project. An attacker who can convince a user to scan a malicious project can include commands in a build file such as build.gradle or gradle-wrapper.jar, which will be executed with the privileges of the application. This vulnerability may be triggered when running the the CLI tool directly, or when running a scan with one of the IDE plugins that invoke the Snyk CLI. Successful exploitation of this issue would likely require some level of social engineering - to coerce an untrusted project to be downloaded and analyzed via the Snyk CLI or opened in an IDE where a Snyk IDE plugin is installed and enabled. Additionally, if the IDE has a Trust feature then the target folder must be marked as ‘trusted’ in order to be vulnerable. **NOTE:** This issue is independent of the one reported in [CVE-2022-40764](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SNYK-3037342), and upgrading to a fixed version for this addresses that issue as well. The affected IDE plugins and versions are: - VS Code - Affected: \u003c=1.8.0, Fixed: 1.9.0 - IntelliJ - Affected: \u003c=2.4.47, Fixed: 2.4.48 - Visual Studio - Affected: \u003c=1.1.30, Fixed: 1.1.31 - Eclipse - Affected: \u003c=v20221115.132308, Fixed: All subsequent versions - Language Server - Affected: \u003c=v20221109.114426, Fixed: All subsequent versions",
