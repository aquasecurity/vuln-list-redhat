A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in `API\\ResponseTrait` in Codeigniter4 prior to version 4.1.8. Attackers can do XSS attacks if a potential victim is using `API\\ResponseTrait`.

Users may avoid using `API\\ResponseTrait` or `ResourceController` Users may also disable Auto Route and use defined routes only.",
