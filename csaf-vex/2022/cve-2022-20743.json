This vulnerability is due to improper validation of files uploaded to the web management interface of Cisco FMC Software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a maliciously crafted file to a device running affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to store malicious files on the device, which they could access later to conduct additional attacks, including executing arbitrary code on the affected device with root privileges.",
