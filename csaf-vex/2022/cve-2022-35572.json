This web page calls a show_sysinfo function which retrieves WPA passwords, SSIDs, MAC Addresses, serial numbers, WPS Pins, and hardware/firmware versions, and prints this information into the web page. This web page is visible when remote management is enabled. A user who has access to the web interface of the device can extract these secrets.
