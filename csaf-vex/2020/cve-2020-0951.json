An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute PowerShell commands that would be blocked by WDAC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker need administrator access on a local machine where PowerShell is running. The attacker could then connect to a PowerShell session and send commands to execute arbitrary code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how PowerShell commands are validated when WDAC protection is enabled.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
