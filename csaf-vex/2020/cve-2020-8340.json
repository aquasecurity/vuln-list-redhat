This vulnerability could allow JavaScript code to be executed in the user's web browser if the user is convinced to visit a crafted URL, possibly through phishing. Successful exploitation requires specific knowledge about the user’s network to be included in the crafted URL. Impact is limited to the normal access restrictions and permissions of the user clicking the crafted URL, and subject to the user being able to connect to and already being authenticated to IMM2 or other systems. The JavaScript code is not executed on IMM2 itself.",
