          "text": "A Race Condition vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS LLDP implementation allows an attacker to cause LLDP to crash leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). This issue occurs when crafted LLDP packets are received by the device from an adjacent device. Multiple LACP flaps will occur after LLDP crashes. An indicator of compromise is to evaluate log file details for lldp with RLIMIT. Intervention should occur before 85% threshold of used KB versus maximum available KB memory is reached. show log messages | match RLIMIT | match lldp | last 20 Matching statement is \" /kernel: %KERNEL-[number]: Process ([pid #],lldpd) has exceeded 85% of RLIMIT_DATA: \" with [] as variable data to evaluate for.
