          "text": "On Juniper Networks Junos OS devices configured as a DHCP forwarder, the Juniper Networks Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Daemon (jdhcp) process might crash when receiving a malformed DHCP packet. This issue only affects devices configured as DHCP forwarder with forward-only option, that forward specified DHCP client packets, without creating a new subscriber session. The jdhcpd daemon automatically restarts without intervention, but continuous receipt of the malformed DHCP packet will repeatedly crash jdhcpd, leading to an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue can be triggered only by DHCPv4, it cannot be triggered by DHCPv6. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S16; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D105 on SRX Series; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D60 on EX and QFX Series; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S7; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D221, 15.1X49-D230 on SRX Series; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D593 on EX2300/EX3400; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S5.",
