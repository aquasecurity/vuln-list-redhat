          "text": "The original design of ICMP does not require authentication for host-generated ICMP error messages, which makes it easier for attackers to forge ICMP error messages for specific TCP connections and cause a denial of service, as demonstrated using (1) blind connection-reset attacks with forged \"Destination Unreachable\" messages, (2) blind throughput-reduction attacks with forged \"Source Quench\" messages, or (3) blind throughput-reduction attacks with forged ICMP messages that cause the Path MTU to be reduced.  NOTE: CVE-2004-0790, CVE-2004-0791, and CVE-2004-1060 have been SPLIT based on different attacks; CVE-2005-0065, CVE-2005-0066, CVE-2005-0067, and CVE-2005-0068 are related identifiers that are SPLIT based on the underlying vulnerability.  While CVE normally SPLITs based on vulnerability, the attack-based identifiers exist due to the variety and number of affected implementations and solutions that address the attacks instead of the underlying vulnerabilities.",
