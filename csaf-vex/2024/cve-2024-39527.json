These files may contain sensitive information that can be used to cause further impact to the system.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS on SRX Series: \n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8, \n  *  22.2 before 22.2R3-S5, \n  *  22.3 before 22.3R3-S4, \n  *  22.4 before 22.4R3-S4, \n  *  23.2 before 23.2R2-S2, \n  *  23.4 before 23.4R2.",
