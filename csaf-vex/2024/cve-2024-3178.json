All administrators have access to the File Manager and hence could create a search filter with the malicious code attached. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.1 with a vector of  AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator .",
