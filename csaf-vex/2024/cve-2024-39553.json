The impacted services MSVCS-DB app crashes momentarily and recovers by itself. \n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: \n  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S7-EVO; \n  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S3-EVO;\n  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R3-S2-EVO;\n  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R3-EVO;\n  *  23.2 versions earlier than 23.2R1-S2-EVO, 23.2R2-EVO.",
