The Concrete CMS Security Team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v4 score of 4.6 with vector CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N Thank you, Yusuke Uchida for reporting. CNA updated this risk rank on 20 Jan 2025 by lowering the AC based on CVSS 4.0 documentation that access privileges should not be considered for AC)",
