The flaw necessitates the manual configuration of an empty ipset name, a scenario that deviates from standard operational procedures. This constraint significantly reduces the likelihood of the vulnerability being exploited in typical deployment environments. Additionally, the primary consequence of this integer overflow is reading from an undefined address, which, while potentially disruptive, is less severe compared to vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation.",
