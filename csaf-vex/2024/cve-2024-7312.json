While the vulnerability can potentially lead to session hijacking or phishing attacks, its impact is contingent upon an attacker successfully tricking a user into visiting a malicious URL. This reliance on user action, coupled with the necessity of additional contextual exploitation, reduces the immediate risk compared to more direct vulnerabilities. Additionally, the server-side exposure is mitigated by the inherent security measures of the Payara Server and the requirement for valid session tokens or authentication credentials.",
