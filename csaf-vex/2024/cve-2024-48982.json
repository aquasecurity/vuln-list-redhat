          "text": "An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. Its hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of certain hci packets by reading a byte from its header. This value is assumed to be greater than or equal to 3, but the software doesn't ensure that this is the case. Supplying a length less than 3 leads to a buffer overflow in a buffer that is allocated later. It is simultaneously possible to cause another integer overflow by supplying large length values because the provided length value is increased by a few bytes to account for additional information that is supposed to be stored there. This bug is trivial to exploit for a denial of service but is not certain to suffice to bring the system down and can generally not be exploited further because the exploitable buffer is dynamically allocated.",
