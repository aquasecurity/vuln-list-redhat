Affected versions contain a Time-of-check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability when used with the default configuration, where a specifically crafted container image may gain access to the host file system. This issue does not impact use cases where CDI is used.\n\nThe original fix for the vulnerability shipped by upstream was incomplete. The fix has been continued on CVE-2025-23359.\n\nThe Container Device Interface (CDI) provides a standardized way to expose hardware devices like GPUs to containers, enabling more secure and predictable deployments. By clearly separating device access from the underlying container runtime, CDI helps contain the impact of bugs or vulnerabilities in device drivers.  This isolation extends across container layers, so even if another container is built on top of one that implements CDI, hardware access remains controlled and protected, preserving security in derivative workloads.\n\n\nA successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering.",

First, a specifically crafted container image is required for effective exploitation. Red Hat signs all containers to ensure their authenticity, integrity and security. If such a container is used either on its own or as a lower layer, this bug can not be exploited. Additionally, this vulnerability is not zero touch, and needs active user interaction to work, further reducing the likelihood of an attack. Most importantly, this vulnerability does not impact use cases that comply with our operating procedures by utilizing the Container Device Interface (CDI).  Furthermore, for an attacker to deploy a crafted container image, they would need an environment that permits untrusted containers, which is a scenario that is not typical for Red Hat customers.",
