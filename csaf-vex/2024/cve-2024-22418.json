It allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code by embedding it within a file's name. For instance, using a filename such as “\u003e\u003cimg src=x onerror=prompt('XSS')\u003e.jpg” triggers the vulnerability. When this file is uploaded, the JavaScript code within the filename is executed. This issue has been addressed in version 6.8.29. All users are advised to upgrade.
