Prior to the 2.9 branch, an attacker with only minimal viewing privileges in the settings section is able to change their user type to Administrator (or another type with super-permissions) through a specifically crafted POST request to `/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, modifying the `nivel_usuario_` parameter. The vulnerability occurs in the file located at `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, which does not check the user's current permission level before allowing changes. Commit c25910cdf11ab50e50162a49dd44bef544422b6e contains a patch for the issue.",
