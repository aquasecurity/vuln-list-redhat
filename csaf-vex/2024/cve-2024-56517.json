Versions up to and including 6.2.1 contain a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the `Referer` HTTP header. The vulnerability allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which is reflected in the HTML response without proper sanitization. When crafted malicious input is provided in the `Referer` header, it is echoed back into an HTML attribute in the application’s response.
