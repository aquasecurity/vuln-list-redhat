          "text": "The User Meta – User Profile Builder and User management plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 3.1 via the getUser() due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to obtain user meta values from form fields. Please note that this requires a site administrator to create a form that displays potentially sensitive information like password hashes. This may also be exploited by unauthenticated users if the  'user-meta-public-profile' shortcode is used insecurely.",
