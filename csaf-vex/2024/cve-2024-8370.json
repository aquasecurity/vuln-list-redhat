This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /api/files/recipepictures/ of the component SVG File Upload Handler. The manipulation of the argument force_serve_as with the input picture' leads to cross site scripting. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. Unfortunately, the project maintainer does not want to be quoted in any way regarding the dispute rationale. The security policy of the project implies that this finding is \"practically irrelevant\" due to authentication requirements.",
