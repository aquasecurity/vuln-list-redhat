This classification is due to the nature of the attack vector, which requires crafted input to exploit the hashing function and induce excessive resource usage. The exploitability of this vulnerability depends on the attacker’s ability to generate and send specifically designed requests, which may limit its practical impact compared to vulnerabilities that allow for more straightforward or widespread attacks. Additionally, the effect is confined to resource exhaustion, which, although disruptive, does not directly lead to unauthorized data access or system compromise.",
