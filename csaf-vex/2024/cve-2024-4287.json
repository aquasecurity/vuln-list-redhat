Specifically, the application fails to validate or format JSON data sent in an HTTP POST request to `/api/workspace/:workspace-slug/update`, allowing it to be executed as part of a database query without restrictions. This flaw enables users with a manager role to craft a request that includes nested write operations, effectively allowing them to create new Administrator accounts.",
