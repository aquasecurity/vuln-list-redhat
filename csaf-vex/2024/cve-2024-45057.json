A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the dynamic generation of HTML fields prior to the 2.9 branch. The file located at `ieducar/intranet/include/clsCampos.inc.php` does not properly validate or sanitize user-controlled input, leading to the vulnerability. Any page that uses this implementation is vulnerable, such as `intranet/educar_curso_lst.php?nm_curso=\u003cpayload\u003e`, `intranet/atendidos_lst.php?nm_pessoa=\u003cpayload\u003e`, `intranet/educar_abandono_tipo_lst?nome=\u003cpayload\u003e`.
