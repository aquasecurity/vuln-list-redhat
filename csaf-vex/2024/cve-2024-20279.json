An attacker with a valid user account associated with a restricted security domain could exploit this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete child policies created under default system policies, which are implicitly used by all tenants in the fabric, resulting in disruption of network traffic. Exploitation is not possible for policies under tenants that an attacker has no authorization to access.",
