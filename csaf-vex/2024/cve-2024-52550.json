Jenkinsfiles often contain critical pipeline scripts that can interact with sensitive systems and data, including environment variables, credentials, and system configurations. If these scripts are not properly approved, malicious or unauthorized code could be executed, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, or data manipulation. The lack of a re-approval check for rebuilt builds bypasses essential security controls, which can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or compromise the integrity of the build process.",
