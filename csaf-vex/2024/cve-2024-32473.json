          "text": "A flaw was found in Moby, an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling and runtimes. In certain versions, IPv6 is not disabled on network interfaces, including those belonging to networks where \"--ipv6=false\". A container with an \"ipvlan\" or \"macvlan\" interface will normally be configured to share an external network link with the host machine, and because of this direct access, containers may be able to communicate with other hosts on the local network over link-local IPv6 addresses. Additionally, if router advertisements are being broadcast over the local network, containers may get SLAAC-assigned addresses and the interface will be a member of IPv6 multicast groups. This means interfaces IPv4-only networks present an unexpectedly and unnecessarily increased attack surface",
