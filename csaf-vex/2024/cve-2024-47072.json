          "text": "This vulnerability in XStream is considered an Important severity rather than Moderate because it exposes applications to a denial of service (DoS) attack with relative ease. By exploiting the flaw in the `BinaryStreamDriver`, an attacker can manipulate the binary input stream to trigger a stack overflow, which terminates the application unexpectedly. Unlike moderate vulnerabilities, which may require specific conditions or limited privileges, this flaw enables remote attackers to forcefully terminate services by crafting malicious input, impacting system availability. Additionally, the vulnerabilityâs reliance on a common serialization mechanism elevates the risk, as it may affect applications across various environments and industries where XStream is deployed.",
