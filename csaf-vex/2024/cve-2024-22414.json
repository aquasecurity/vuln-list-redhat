The html template `user.html` contains the following code snippet to render comments made by a user: `\u003cdiv class=\"content\" tag=\"content\"\u003e{{comment[2]|safe}}\u003c/div\u003e`. Use of the \"safe\" tag causes flask to _not_ escape the rendered content. To remediate this, simply remove the `|safe` tag from the HTML above. No fix is is available and users are advised to manually edit their installation.",
