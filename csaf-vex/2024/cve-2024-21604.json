Please note that a carefully designed lo0 firewall filter will block or limit these packets which should prevent this issue from occurring.\n\nThe following log messages can be seen when this issue occurs:\n\n\u003chost\u003e kernel: nf_conntrack: nf_conntrack: table full, dropping packet\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved:\n\n\n\n  *  All versions earlier than 20.4R3-S7-EVO;\n  *  21.2R1-EVO and later versions;\n  *  21.4-EVO versions earlier than 21.4R3-S5-EVO;\n  *  22.1-EVO versions earlier than 22.1R3-S2-EVO;\n  *  22.2-EVO versions earlier than 22.2R3-EVO;\n  *  22.3-EVO versions earlier than 22.3R2-EVO;\n  *  22.4-EVO versions earlier than 22.4R2-EVO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
