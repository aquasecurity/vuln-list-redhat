This flaw allows attackers to craft malicious requests that can trigger state-changing operations on behalf of an authenticated user, potentially compromising account settings and data integrity. The vulnerability only affects a limited set of state-changing operations, and successful exploitation requires social engineering to trick a user with access to the management console into performing the malicious action.",
