The impact of the l2cpd crash is reinitialization of STP protocols (RSTP, MSTP or VSTP), and MVRP and ERP. Also, if any services depend on LLDP state (like PoE or VoIP device recognition), then these will also be affected.\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS\n\n\n\n  *  All versions prior to 20.4R3-S8;\n  *  21.1 version 21.1R1 and later versions;\n  *  21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S5;\n  *  21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S4;\n  *  21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S3;\n  *  22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S2;\n  *  22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3;\n  *  22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2-S2;\n  *  22.4 versions prior to 22.4R2;\n\n\n\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS Evolved\n\n\n\n  *  All versions prior to 20.4R3-S8-EVO;\n  *  21.1 version 21.1R1-EVO and later versions;\n  *  21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S5-EVO;\n  *  21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S4-EVO;\n  *  21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S3-EVO;\n  *  22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S2-EVO;\n  *  22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3-EVO;\n  *  22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2-S2-EVO;\n  *  22.4 versions prior to 22.4R1-S1-EVO;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
