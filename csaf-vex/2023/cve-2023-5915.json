While sending the packet, the maintenance homepage of the controller could not be accessed. Therefore, functions of the maintenance homepage, changing configuration, viewing logs, etc. are not available. But the controller’s operation is not stopped by the condition.\n\nThe affected products and versions are as follows: STARDOM FCN/FCJ R1.01 to R4.31.\n",
