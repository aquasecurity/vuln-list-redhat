Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to versions 1.5.1 and 2.1.2, due to an encoding issue in the serialization layer, malicious markup nested in a `noscript` element was not encoded correctly. `noscript` is disabled in the default configuration, but might have been enabled in custom scenarios. This allows bypassing the cross-site scripting mechanism of TYPO3 HTML Sanitizer. Versions 1.5.1 and 2.1.2 fix the problem.",
