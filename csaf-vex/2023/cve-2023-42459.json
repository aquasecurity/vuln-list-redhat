In affected versions specific DATA submessages can be sent to a discovery locator which may trigger a free error. This can remotely crash any Fast-DDS process. The call to free() could potentially leave the pointer in the attackers control which could lead to a double free. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.12.0, 2.11.3, 2.10.3, and 2.6.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
