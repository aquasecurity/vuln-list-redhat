No permissions or special privileges are necessary to exploit the vulnerability in the com.tct.gcs.hiddenmenuproxy app. No user interaction is required beyond installing and running a third-party app. The software build fingerprints for each confirmed vulnerable build are as follows: TCL/5087Z_BO/Doha_TMO:11/RP1A.200720.011/PB7I-0:user/release-keys and TCL/5087Z_BO/Doha_TMO:11/RP1A.200720.011/PB83-0:user/release-keys. This malicious app sends a broadcast intent to the exported com.tct.gcs.hiddenmenuproxy/.rtn.FactoryResetReceiver receiver component, which initiates a programmatic factory reset.",
