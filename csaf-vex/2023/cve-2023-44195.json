This can lead to a limited, increased consumption of resources resulting in a Denial-of-Service (DoS), and unauthorized access.\n\nCVE-2023-44196 is a prerequisite for this issue.\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved:\n\n\n\n  *  21.3-EVO versions prior to 21.3R3-S5-EVO;\n  *  21.4-EVO versions prior to 21.4R3-S4-EVO;\n  *  22.1-EVO version 22.1R1-EVO and later;\n  *  22.2-EVO version 22.2R1-EVO and later;\n  *  22.3-EVO versions prior to 22.3R2-S2-EVO, 22.3R3-S1-EVO;\n  *  22.4-EVO versions prior to 22.4R3-EVO.\n\n\n\n\nThis issue doesn't not affected Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 21.3R1-EVO.\n\n\n\n",
