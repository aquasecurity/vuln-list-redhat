Under race conditions, the LDP agent can establish an LDP session with a malicious peer potentially allowing the possibility of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on route updates and in turn potentially leading to an Out of Memory (OOM) condition that is disruptive to traffic forwarding. Affected EOS versions include: 4.22 release train: 4.22.1F and earlier releases 4.21 release train: 4.21.0F - 4.21.2.3F, 4.21.3F - 4.21.7.1M 4.20 release train: 4.20.14M and earlier releases 4.19 release train: 4.19.12M and earlier releases End of support release trains (4.18 and 4.17)",
