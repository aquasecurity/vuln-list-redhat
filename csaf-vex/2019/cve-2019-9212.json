NOTE: The vendor doesn’t consider this issue a vulnerability because the blacklist is being misused. SOFA Hessian supports custom blacklist and a disclaimer was posted encouraging users to update the blacklist or to use the whitelist feature for their specific needs since the blacklist is not being actively updated",
