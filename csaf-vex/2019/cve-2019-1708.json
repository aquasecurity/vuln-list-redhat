The vulnerability is due to the incorrect processing of certain MOBIKE packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted MOBIKE packets to an affected device to be processed. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume memory and eventually reload, resulting in a DoS condition. The MOBIKE feature is supported only for IPv4 addresses.",
