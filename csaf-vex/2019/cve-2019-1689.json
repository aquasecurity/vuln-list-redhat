The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the client application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious file to a targeted user and persuading the user to manually open it. An exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite sensitive application files and eventually cause a denial of service (DoS) condition by foreclosing future access to the system to the targeted user. This vulnerability is fixed in version 3.13.26920.",
