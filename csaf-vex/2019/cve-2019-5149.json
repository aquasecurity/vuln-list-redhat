However, the default configuration of this module appears to limit the number of concurrent php-cgi processes to two, which can be abused to cause a denial of service of the entire web server. This affects WAGO PFC200 Firmware version 03.00.39(12) and version 03.01.07(13), and WAGO PFC100 Firmware version 03.00.39(12) and version 03.02.02(14).",
