          "text": "A vulnerability in the NX-API feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code as root. The vulnerability is due to incorrect input validation in the NX-API feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP or HTTPS request to an internal service on an affected device that has the NX-API feature enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code as root. Note: The NX-API feature is disabled by default. MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches are affected in versions prior to 8.1(1). Nexus 3000 Series Switches are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)I4(8) and 7.0(3)I7(1). Nexus 3500 Platform Switches are affected in versions prior to 6.0(2)A8(8). Nexus 3600 Platform Switches are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)F3(5). Nexus 2000, 5500, 5600, and 6000 Series Switches are affected in versions prior to 7.3(2)N1(1). Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches are affected in versions prior to 7.3(3)D1(1). Nexus 9000 Series Switches in Standalone NX-OS Mode are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)I4(8) and 7.0(3)I7(1).
