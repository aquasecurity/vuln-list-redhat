Exploitation of this issue requires an attacker to have access to a virtual machine with 3D graphics enabled. Successful exploitation of this issue may lead to information disclosure or may allow attackers with normal user privileges to create a denial-of-service condition on their own VM. The workaround for this issue involves disabling the 3D-acceleration feature. This feature is not enabled by default on ESXi and is enabled by default on Workstation and Fusion.",
