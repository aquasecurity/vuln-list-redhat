A malicous access point or adjacent user can determine if a connected user is using a VPN by making positive inferences about the websites they are visiting, and determining the correct sequence and acknowledgement numbers in use, which allows the attacker to inject data into the TCP stream. With this information, an attacker could hijack an active connection inside the VPN tunnel.
