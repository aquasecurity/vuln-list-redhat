    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Wildfly Server Role Based Access Control (RBAC) provider. When authorization to control management operations is secured using the Role Based Access Control provider, a user without the required privileges can suspend or resume the server. A user with a Monitor or Auditor role is supposed to have only read access permissions and should not be able to suspend the server. \nThe vulnerability is caused by the Suspend and Resume handlers not performing authorization checks to validate whether the current user has the required permissions to proceed with the action. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat has evaluated this issue and the attacker must be authenticated as a user that belongs to the \"Monitor\" or \"Auditor\" management groups. It requires previous privileges to jeopardize an environment.",
