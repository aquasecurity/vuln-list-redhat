    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in curl. When curl is asked to use HSTS, the expiry time for a subdomain might overwrite a parent domain's cache entry, making it end sooner or later than intended. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw has been classified with a low severity primarily because it requires user interaction and a connection to a malicious subdomain. Additionally, this issue is only triggered when an HSTS cache file is being used with specific configurations when connecting to a malicious subdomain. This feature is enabled via the '--hsts' command line option. Furthermore, this issue will only cause parent domains that support HSTS for a short period of time and want to revert to HTTP to become inaccessible.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
