    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the mod_proxy_ajp module of httpd. The connection is not closed when there is an invalid Transfer-Encoding header, allowing an attacker to smuggle requests to the AJP server, where it forwards requests. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw only affects configurations with mod_proxy_ajp loaded and with an AJP backend configured. If there is no proxy configured to an AJP backend the server is not affected and no further mitigation is needed. For more information about the mitigation, check the mitigation section below.\n\nThe httpd mod_proxy_ajp module is enabled by default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, 8, 9, and in RHSCL. However, there are no directives forwarding requests using the AJP protocol.\n\nThis flaw has been rated as having a security impact of moderate, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata.\n            MITIGATION: Disabling mod_proxy_ajp and restarting httpd will mitigate this flaw.",
