This flaw allows an attacker to insert cookies into a running program using libcurl if the specific series of conditions are met. \n            STATEMENT: The flaw requires a series of conditions to be met and the likeliness that they shall allow an attacker to take advantage of it is low. Even if the bug could be made to trigger, the risk that a cookie injection can be done to cause harm is additionally also low.",
