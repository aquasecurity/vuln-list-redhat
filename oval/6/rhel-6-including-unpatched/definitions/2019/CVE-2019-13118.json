Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a security impact of Low.\n* Red Hat OpenStack Platform versions 9, 10, 13, \u0026 14 are marked WONTFIX as they will inherit fixes from the underlying RHEL layer.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having a security impact of Low, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.
