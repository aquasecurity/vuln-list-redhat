    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the KDE Frameworks KConfig prior to version 5.61.0. Certain syntax commands were allowed in .desktop, .directory, and configuration files to allow flexible configurations with the desktop environment. An attacker could add malicious code to a file that a user would unintentionally install, thus executing the malicious code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of kdelibs as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Extended Life Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having a security impact of Important, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",
