    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The CVE program describes this issue as: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxsk: Fix race at socket teardown\n\nFix a race in the xsk socket teardown code that can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference splat. The current xsk unbind code in xsk_unbind_dev() starts by\nsetting xs-\u003estate to XSK_UNBOUND, sets xs-\u003edev to NULL and then waits for any\nNAPI processing to terminate using synchronize_net(). After that, the release\ncode starts to tear down the socket state and free allocated memory.\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000c0\n  PGD 8000000932469067 P4D 8000000932469067 PUD 0\n  Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI\n  CPU: 25 PID: 69132 Comm: grpcpp_sync_ser Tainted: G          I       5.16.0+ #2\n  Hardware name: Dell Inc.

First, setting xs-\u003edev to NULL\nbefore waiting for all users to stop using the socket is not correct. The\nentry to the data plane functions xsk_poll(), xsk_sendmsg(), and xsk_recvmsg()\nare all guarded by a test that xs-\u003estate is in the state XSK_BOUND and if not,\nit returns right away. But one process might have passed this test but still\nhave not gotten to the point in which it uses xs-\u003edev in the code. In this\ninterim, a second process executing xsk_unbind_dev() might have set xs-\u003edev to\nNULL which will lead to a crash for the first process. The solution here is\njust to get rid of this NULL assignment since it is not used anymore. Before\ncommit 42fddcc7c64b (\"xsk: use state member for socket synchronization\"),\nxs-\u003edev was the gatekeeper to admit processes into the data plane functions,\nbut it was replaced with the state variable xs-\u003estate in the aforementioned\ncommit.\n\nThe second problem is that synchronize_net() does not wait for any process in\nxsk_poll(), xsk_sendmsg(), or xsk_recvmsg() to complete, which means that the\nstate they rely on might be cleaned up prematurely. This can happen when the\nnotifier gets called (at driver unload for example) as it uses xsk_unbind_dev().\nSolve this by extending the RCU critical region from just the ndo_xsk_wakeup\nto the whole functions mentioned above, so that both the test of xs-\u003estate ==\nXSK_BOUND and the last use of any member of xs is covered by the RCU critical\nsection. This will guarantee that when synchronize_net() completes, there will\nbe no processes left executing xsk_poll(), xsk_sendmsg(), or xsk_recvmsg() and\nstate can be cleaned up safely. Note that we need to drop the RCU lock for the\nskb xmit path as it uses functions that might sleep. Due to this, we have to\nretest the xs-\u003estate after we grab the mutex that protects the skb xmit code\nfrom, among a number of things, an xsk_unbind_dev() being executed from the\nnotifier at the same time. \n            STATEMENT: This issue has been fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.1 via RHSA-2022:8267 [1].\n\n[1]. https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8267\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
