This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.Redhat satellite 6 does not ship libyaml\n\nThe Red Hat security response team has rated this issue as having low security impact in Red Hat Update Infrastructure. A future update may address this issue. \n\nThe Red Hat security response team has rated this issue as having moderate security impact in Subscription Asset Manager 1. A future update may address this issue.\n\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
