    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all configurations), and 9.4.x (non-default configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled), HTTP/0.9 is handled poorly. An HTTP/1 style request line (i.e. method space URI space version) that declares a version of HTTP/0.9 was accepted and treated as a 0.9 request. If deployed behind an intermediary that also accepted and passed through the 0.9 version (but did not act on it), then the response sent could be interpreted by the intermediary as HTTP/1 headers. This could be used to poison the cache if the server allowed the origin client to generate arbitrary content in the response. \n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of jetty embedded in the nutch package as shipped with Red Hat Satellite 5. The nutch service is not exposed, as such exploitation is difficult, Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having security impact of Low. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.\n\nData Grid 7 has deprecated the agent-bond utility that permits this flaw; it is disabled by default and is no longer supported. While the functionality is still available for backward-compatibility usage, customers are strongly recommended to use Prometheus JMX instead. As the functionality is deprecated and no longer supported, the flaw has been scored as Moderate for Data Grid 7.\n\nData Grid 8 is not affected by this flaw.",
