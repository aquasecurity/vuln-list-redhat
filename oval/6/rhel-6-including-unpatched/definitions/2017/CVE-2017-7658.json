    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: In Eclipse Jetty Server, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all non HTTP/1.x configurations), and 9.4.x (all HTTP/1.x configurations), when presented with two content-lengths headers, Jetty ignored the second. When presented with a content-length and a chunked encoding header, the content-length was ignored (as per RFC 2616). If an intermediary decided on the shorter length, but still passed on the longer body, then body content could be interpreted by Jetty as a pipelined request. If the intermediary was imposing authorization, the fake pipelined request would bypass that authorization. \n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of jetty embedded in the nutch package as shipped with Red Hat Satellite 5. The nutch service is not exposed, as such exploitation is difficult, Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having security impact of Low. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.\n\nThis issue affects the version of jetty in Red Hat Data Grid 7's agent-bond utility, which is deprecated and only available for backward compatibility. Customers should use Prometheus JMX instead. This flaw does not affect Red Hat Data Grid 8.",
