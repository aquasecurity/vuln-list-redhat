    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was found that Apache Lucene would accept an object from an unauthenticated user that could be manipulated through subsequent post requests. An attacker could use this flaw to assemble an object that could permit execution of arbitrary code if the server enabled Apache Solr's Config API. \n            STATEMENT: The following products are not affected by this flaw, as they do not use the vulnerable functionality of either aspect of the issue.\nRed Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6\nRed Hat JBoss BPM Suite\nRed Hat JBoss BRMS\nRed Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager\nRed Hat Single Sign-On 7\nRed Hat JBoss Portal Platform 6\n\nRed Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7 is not affected by this flaw. However, it does ship the vulnerable Lucene class in a dependency to another component. Customers who reuse the lucene-queryparser jar in their applications may be vulnerable to the External Entity Expansion aspect of this flaw. This will be patched in a forthcoming release.\n\nRed Hat JBoss Fuse is not affected by this flaw, as it does not use the vulnerable functionality of either aspect of this flaw. Fuse customers who may be running external Solr servers, while not affected from the Fuse side, are advised to secure their Solr servers as recommended in the mitigation provided.\n\nThe following products ship only the Lucene components relevant to this flaw, and are not vulnerable to the second portion of the vulnerability, the code execution exploit. As such, the impact of this flaw has been determined to be Moderate for these respective products:\nRed Hat JBoss Data Grid 7 \nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6\nRed Hat Software Collections 2.4\n\nThis issue did not affect the versions of lucene as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nThis issue does not affect Elasticsearch as shipped in OpenShift Container Platform.\n            MITIGATION: Until fixes are available, all Solr users are advised to restart their Solr instances with the system parameter `-Ddisable.configEdit=true`. This will disallow any changes to be made to configurations via the Config API. This is a key factor in this vulnerability, since it allows GET requests to add the RunExecutableListener to the config.\n\nThis is sufficient to protect from this type of attack, but means you cannot use the edit capabilities of the Config API until further fixes are in place.",
