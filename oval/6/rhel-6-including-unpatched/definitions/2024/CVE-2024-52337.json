    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A log spoofing flaw was found in the Tuned package due to improper sanitization of some API arguments. This flaw allows an attacker to pass a controlled sequence of characters; newlines can be inserted into the log. Instead of the 'evil' the attacker could mimic a valid TuneD log line and trick the administrator. The quotes '' are usually used in TuneD logs citing raw user input, so there will always be the ' character ending the spoofed input, and the administrator can easily overlook this. This logged string is later used in logging and in the output of utilities, for example, `tuned-adm get_instances` or other third-party programs that use Tuned's D-Bus interface for such operations. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is classified as moderate severity instead of important because it primarily affects the integrity of logging rather than directly compromising system confidentiality, availability, or functionality. While an attacker can manipulate log entries to mislead administrators or obfuscate their actions, the impact is limited to the interpretation of logs and does not inherently grant the attacker elevated privileges or direct control over the system. Additionally, the spoofing relies on administrators overlooking inconsistencies, making the success of exploitation context-dependent and less universally impactful. These factors reduce the overall risk compared to vulnerabilities that enable direct compromise or significant disruption.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
