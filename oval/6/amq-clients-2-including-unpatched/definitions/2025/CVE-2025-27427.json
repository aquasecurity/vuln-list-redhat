    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. This vulnerability allows a user with createDurableQueue or createNonDurableQueue permissions to augment the routing-type of an address without the createAddress permission. When combined with the send permission and automatic queue creation, an attacker could send messages with unsupported routing-types, bypassing intended restrictions. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
