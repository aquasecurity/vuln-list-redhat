    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in libxml2 where improper handling of memory allocation failures in `libxml2` can lead to crashes, memory leaks, or inconsistent states. While an attacker cannot directly control allocation failures, they may trigger denial-of-service conditions under extreme system stress. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability marked as moderate instead of important because memory allocation failures are not typically controllable by an attacker, limiting their exploitability. While improper handling of malloc failures can lead to crashes, memory leaks, or inconsistent states, it does not directly result in privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution. \n\nAdditionally, in most real-world scenarios, failures due to memory exhaustion occur under extreme system stress rather than as part of an intentional attack vector.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
