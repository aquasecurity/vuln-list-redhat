    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A Kerberos elevation of privilege vulnerability was found in all versions Samba AD DC. It exploits weaknesses in the RC4-HMAC cipher, allowing a service account with constrained delegation permission to forge a more powerful Kerberos ticket. This flaw could enable privilege escalation by adding unauthorized groups to the Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) without knowing the krbtgt key. \n            STATEMENT: The Samba package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, 8 and 9 Red Hat Gluster is not affected by this issue as Red Hat doesn't provide the AD domain controller capability with it.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
