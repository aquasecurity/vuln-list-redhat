    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in libexpat's xmlparse.c component. This vulnerability allows an attacker to cause improper handling of XML data by providing a negative length value to the XML_ParseBuffer function. \n            STATEMENT: The CVE-2024-45490 vulnerability is rated as moderate severity because while it allows for memory corruption through improper argument handling in XML_ParseBuffer, the exploitability is limited. Specifically, it requires an unlikely scenario where the input passed to the function has a negative length (len \u003c 0), which would typically not occur in well-formed applications. Moreover, while the impact includes denial of service (DoS), the conditions necessary for arbitrary code execution are non-trivial, requiring specific exploitation of memory corruption. Since it primarily leads to application crashes without an easily accessible attack vector for remote code execution, the risk is lower compared to higher-severity vulnerabilities that offer more direct pathways to exploitation.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
