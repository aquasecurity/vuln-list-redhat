    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's driver for Human Interface Devices. This flaw allows an attacker to use a malicious input device to read information from the report buffer. This could be used to leak kernel memory, enabling the exploitation of additional vulnerabilities. \n            STATEMENT: While this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of kernel memory, the impact is rated Moderate because exploitation  requires bypassing additional security features such as kernel address-space layout randomization (KASLR). It could be exploited by an authenticated, local attacker who emulates a malicious Human Interface Device (HID).\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
