    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's USB Audio driver. This flaw allows an attacker with physical access to the system to use a malicious USB device to gain additional access. This is possible by manipulating system memory, potentially escalating privileges, or executing arbitrary code. \n            STATEMENT: This CVE marked as important vulnerability because it allows a malicious or compromised USB device to trigger out-of-bounds memory accesses in the Linux kernelâ€™s ALSA USB audio subsystem. This occurs due to improper handling of bNumConfigurations, which can lead to memory corruption or even privilege escalation if exploited. Since USB devices can be dynamically plugged in, an attacker with physical access could potentially exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code in kernel space or cause a system crash.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
