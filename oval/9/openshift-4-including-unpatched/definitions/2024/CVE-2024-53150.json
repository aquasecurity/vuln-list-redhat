    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's USB Audio driver. This flaw can allow an attacker with physical access to the system to use a malicious USB device to gain additional access. This is possible by reading arbitrary system memory. \n            \n            MITIGATION: To mitigate this issue, prevent module snd-usb-audio from being loaded.\n\nAs the snd_usb_audio module will be auto-loaded when a usb device is hot plugged, the module can be prevented by loading with the following instructions:\n\n# echo \"install snd_usb_audio /bin/true\" \u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/disable-snd-usb-audio.conf\n\nThe system will need to be restarted if the modules are loaded. In most circumstances, the sound kernel modules will be unable to be unloaded while any programs are active and the device are in use.\n\nIf the system requires this module to work correctly, this mitigation may not be suitable.\n\nIf you need further assistance, see KCS article https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 or contact Red Hat Global Support Services.",
