    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the python-certifi package. This issue occurs when the e-Tugra root certificate in Certifi is removed, resulting in an unspecified error that has an unknown impact and attack vector. \n            STATEMENT: While eTurgra certificates being marked as untrusted by Mozilla is significant from a trust and security standpoint, this is still considered a low severity issue. The certificates were removed from Mozilla's root store in July 2023, indicating a proactive response to security concerns. Additionally, Red Hat does not run its own root store program, but depends on Mozilla for ssl certificates and Microsoft for signing certificates. \nThese certs are included and marked as don't trust and will not be removed until Mozilla removes them. Browsers are most at risk, which already understand and parse 'don't trust after'. If python-fi is required not to trust these certs, they should parse the 'don't trust after' attribute.",
