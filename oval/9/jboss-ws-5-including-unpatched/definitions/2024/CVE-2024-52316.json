    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Apache Tomcat when configured to use a custom Jakarta Authentication (formerly JASPIC) ServerAuthContext component. This vulnerability allows authentication bypass via improperly handled exceptions during the authentication process. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security has assessed this flaw at Attack Complexity as High, and impact metrics Confidentiality and Integrity as High, with a resultant base flaw Security Impact of Important. However, the factors involved in successful exploitation--usage of a custom Jakarta ServerAuthContext component, possible mishandling of exception management in that custom component, and failure in such a way as to allow a failed authentication to proceed in that exception mishandling--are sufficiently unlikely, such that Apache determined the impact to be Low. While Red Hat concurs with the worst-case assessment of Important for the base flaw, all products are assessed as Low, per individual risk assessment and in concurrence with Apache's rating.\n\nRed Hat Satellite is not directly impacted by this issue as it does not include the affected Tomcat package. However, Tomcat is consumed by Candlepin, a component of Satellite. Red Hat Satellite users are advised to check the impact state of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as any necessary fixes will be distributed through the platform.",
