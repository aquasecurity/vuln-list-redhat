    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in GStreamer. Due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, an integer overflow can be triggered when parsing MDPR chunks. In certain configurations, this flaw allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability marked as an Important severity rather than Moderate due to its potential impact and exploitation ease. The flaw involves an integer overflow during the parsing of MDPR chunks in RealMedia files, leading to improper memory allocation. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious file that can execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable process. Given that GStreamer is widely used across various applications for media processing, the attack surface is substantial. Additionally, the vulnerability provides remote code execution capabilities, which is a critical security threat as it can lead to full system compromise, especially when executed with elevated privileges or in widely deployed systems.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
