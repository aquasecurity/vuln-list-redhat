    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the mod_rewrite module of httpd. Improper escaping of output allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations permitted to be served by the server but are not intentionally or directly reachable by any URL. This issue results in code execution or source code disclosure. \n            STATEMENT: This issue affects configurations with substitution rules used in the RewriteRule directive using backreferences or variables as the first segment of the substitution.\n\nAdditionally, this flaw requires mod_rewrite to be loaded and used. This module can be disabled if its functionality is not needed.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is not affected by this vulnerability because the vulnerable code was introduced in a newer version of httpd.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
