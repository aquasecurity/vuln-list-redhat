    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the mod_rewrite module of httpd. A potential SSRF allows an attacker to cause unsafe rules used in the RewriteRule directive to unexpectedly set up URLs to be handled by the mod_proxy module. \n            STATEMENT: This issue only affects configurations with unsafe rules used in the RewriteRule directive.\n\nAdditionally, this flaw requires mod_rewrite and mod_proxy to be loaded and being used. These modules can be disabled via the configuration file if their functionality are not needed.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is not affected by this vulnerability because the vulnerable code was introduced in a newer version of httpd.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
