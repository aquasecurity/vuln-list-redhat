    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in httpd. An HTTP response splitting in multiple httpd modules may allow an attacker that can inject malicious response headers into backend applications to cause an HTTP desynchronization attack. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw only affects configurations when at least one of the following modules is loaded and being used: mod_authnz_fcgi, mod_cgi, mod_cgid, mod_proxy_fcgi, mod_proxy_scgi and mod_proxy_uwsgi. Additionally, this flaw is only exploitable by a malicious backend in a reverse proxy configuration or an attack against a backend application that inserts headers.\n\nThese modules are enabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, 9, and in RHSCL mod_authnz_fcgi is not available in RHEL8 and RHSCL. These modules can be disabled via the configuration file if their functionality is not being used.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
