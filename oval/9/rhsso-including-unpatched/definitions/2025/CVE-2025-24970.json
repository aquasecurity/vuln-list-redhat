    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Netty's SslHandler. This vulnerability allows a native crash via a specially crafted packet that bypasses proper validation. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in Netty's SslHandler is of important severity rather than moderate because it directly impacts the stability and reliability of applications using native SSLEngine. By sending a specially crafted packet, an attacker can trigger a native crash, leading to a complete process termination. Unlike typical moderate vulnerabilities that might cause limited disruptions or require specific conditions, this flaw can be exploited remotely to induce a Denial of Service (DoS), affecting high-availability systems and mission-critical services.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
