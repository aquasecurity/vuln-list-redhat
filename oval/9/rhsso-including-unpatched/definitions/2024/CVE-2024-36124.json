    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the iq80 Snappy compression/decompression library. When uncompressing certain data, Snappy tries to read outside the bounds of the given byte arrays. Because Snappy uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access, no additional bounds checks are performed, and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++. This issue can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
