    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Protocol Buffers (protobuf). This issue can allows an attacker to cause a StackOverflow via parsing untrusted Protocol Buffers data containing arbitrarily nested SGROUP tags, leading to unbounded recursion. \n            STATEMENT: This issue represents a significant severity risk because unbounded recursion in Protocol Buffers parsing can be exploited to trigger stack overflows, leading to Denial of Service (DoS). When parsers, such as `DiscardUnknownFieldsParser` or the Java Protobuf Lite parser, encounter arbitrarily nested groups or deeply recursive map fields, the lack of recursion depth limits can result in uncontrolled stack growth. Attackers can craft malicious protobuf messages that deliberately exceed the stack's capacity, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.\n\nThe protobuf package as shipped in RHEL does not include the affected java or kotlin bindings, therefore RHEL is Not Affected.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
