    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the iq80 Snappy compression/decompression library. When uncompressing certain data, Snappy tries to read outside the bounds of the given byte arrays. Because Snappy uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access, no additional bounds checks are performed, and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++. This issue can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. \n            STATEMENT: iq80 Snappy is not actively maintained. As a quick fix, users can upgrade to version 0.5.",
