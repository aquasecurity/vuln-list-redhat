    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A resource consumption flaw was found in python-werkzeug. If a specially crafted file is uploaded by a remote attacker, it may cause a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: The vulnerability found in python-werkzeug, which lets attackers carry out denial of service attacks by using carefully crafted multipart data, is considered a moderate issue because it could affect system resources and availability. When this vulnerability is exploited, it can cause the CPU to work excessively hard because the parsing mechanism keeps adding data chunks to an internal buffer without checking boundaries properly. This can result in legitimate requests being delayed or denied as worker processes get overloaded, affecting how well the web application performs and responds. While this problem doesn’t directly compromise data integrity or confidentiality, exploiting it can disrupt the availability of the service, which is why it’s seen as a moderate issue.",
