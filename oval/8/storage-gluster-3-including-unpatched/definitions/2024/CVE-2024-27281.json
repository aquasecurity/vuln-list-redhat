    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Rubygem RDoc. When parsing .rdoc_options used for configuration in RDoc as a YAML file there are no restrictions on the classes that can be restored. This issue may lead to object injection, resulting in remote code execution. \n            STATEMENT: An attacker would need to provide a maliciously crafted configuration file or documentation cache to a user in order to trigger this vulnerability.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
