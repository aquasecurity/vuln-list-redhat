    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Werkzeug, where an attacker may be able to execute code on a developer's machine under some circumstances. This issue requires the attacker to get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control and enter the debugger PIN; if they are successful, it allows access to the debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires the attacker to guess a URL in the developer's application that will trigger the debugger. \n            STATEMENT: Werkzeug's debugger allows an attacker to potentially execute code on a developer's machine. This can occur if the attacker tricks the developer into interacting with a controlled domain and subdomain and entering the debugger PIN. Although the debugger is meant to run locally, successful exploitation can give the attacker access to it by guessing a specific URL that triggers the debugger. The severity is rate as IMPORTANT because this flaw can potentially impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability if the attacker can gain control.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
