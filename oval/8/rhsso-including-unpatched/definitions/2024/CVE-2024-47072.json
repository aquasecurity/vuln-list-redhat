    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the XStream library. A remote attacker may trigger a denial of service by manipulating the processed input stream when XStream is configured to use the BinaryStreamDriver. This issue may lead to the termination of the application. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in XStream is considered an Important severity rather than Moderate because it exposes applications to a denial of service (DoS) attack with relative ease. By exploiting the flaw in the `BinaryStreamDriver`, an attacker can manipulate the binary input stream to trigger a stack overflow, which terminates the application unexpectedly. Unlike moderate vulnerabilities, which may require specific conditions or limited privileges, this flaw enables remote attackers to forcefully terminate services by crafting malicious input, impacting system availability. Additionally, the vulnerabilityâ€™s reliance on a common serialization mechanism elevates the risk, as it may affect applications across various environments and industries where XStream is deployed.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
