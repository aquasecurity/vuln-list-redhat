    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in Apache Camel. This flaw allows an attacker to bypass filtering via a specially crafted request containing a certain combination of upper and lower case characters due to an issue in the default header filtering mechanism, which blocks headers starting with \"Camel\" or \"camel.\" \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is rated as having Moderate impact because it can only be triggered under certain configurations and does not enable complete takeover of the system. In order to be vulnerable, a system using the Apache Camel Framework must specifically be using the camel-bean component as a producer and the exchange is coming from a http-based consumer, such as HTTP component or platform-http. If exploitation occurs, an attacker could call other methods on that bean already in the classpath, but not from other arbitrary java beans, System.getenv, nor part of JDK itself.\n            MITIGATION: Remove headers from your Camel routes; this can be accomplished in several ways, including globally or per route.",
