    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Jinja2 package. A bug in the Jinja compiler allows an attacker that controls both the content and filename of a template to execute arbitrary Python code, regardless of Jinja's sandbox being used. An attacker needs to be able to control both the filename and the contents of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications that execute untrusted templates where the template author can also choose the template filename. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
