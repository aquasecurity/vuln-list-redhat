    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Waitress WSGI server for Python. A remote client can send a request that is exactly `recv_bytes`, which defaults to 8192 long, followed by a secondary request using HTTP pipelining. When request lookahead is disabled (default), Waitress won't read any more requests, and when the first request fails due to a parsing error, it simply closes the connection. \n\nHowever when request lookahead is enabled, it is possible to process and receive the first request, start sending the error message back to the client while we read the next request and queue it. This will allow the secondary request to be serviced by the worker thread while the connection should be closed. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Disable `channel_request_lookahead`. This feature is disabled (set to 0) by default.",
