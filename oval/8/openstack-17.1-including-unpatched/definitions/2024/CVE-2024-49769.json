    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Waitress WSGI server for Python. When a remote client closes the connection before waitress has had the opportunity to call `getpeername()`, waitress will incorrectly clean up the connection, leading to the main thread attempting to write to a socket that no longer exists, and that socket is not removed from the list of sockets to attempt to process. This leads to a busy-loop calling the write function. A remote attacker could exhaust the available sockets with very little resources required. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
