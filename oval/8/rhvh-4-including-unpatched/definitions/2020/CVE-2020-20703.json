    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A use-after-free flaw was found in Vim. This issue allows a heap buffer overflow leading to a write access violation. This flaw allows the attacker to possibly have control over the write address and value, which may lead to an application crash. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a Low security impact, because the \"victim\" has to run an untrusted file IN SCRIPT MODE. Someone who is running untrusted files in script mode is equivalent to someone just taking a random python script and running it.\n\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/\n            MITIGATION: Untrusted vim scripts with -s [scriptin] are not recommended to run.",
