    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the tempfile.TemporaryDirectory class in python3/cpython3. The class may dereference symbolic links during permission-related errors, resulting in users that run privileged programs being able to modify permissions of files referenced by the symbolic link. \n            STATEMENT: Versions of python36:3.6/python36 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 are marked as 'Not affected' as they just provide \"symlinks\" to the main python3 component, which provides the actual interpreter of the Python programming language.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
