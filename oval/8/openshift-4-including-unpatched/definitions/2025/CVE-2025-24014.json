    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The CVE program describes this issue as: Vim is an open source, command line text editor. A segmentation fault was found in Vim before 9.1.1043. In silent Ex mode (-s -e), Vim typically doesn't show a screen and just operates silently in batch mode. However, it is still possible to trigger the function that handles the scrolling of a gui version of Vim by feeding some binary characters to Vim. The function that handles the scrolling however may be triggering a redraw, which will access the ScreenLines pointer, even so this variable hasn't been allocated (since there is no screen). This vulnerability is fixed in 9.1.1043. \n            STATEMENT: In order to trigger this issue, a local user must intentionally and explicitly feed some binary data to Vim in ex mode. Thus, Red Hat considers the impact Low.",
