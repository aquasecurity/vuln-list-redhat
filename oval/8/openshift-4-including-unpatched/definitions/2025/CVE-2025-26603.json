    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Vim's :redir command. This vulnerability allows a use-after-free condition via redirecting the :display command to a clipboard register (* or +), which allows access to freed memory. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw is marked as Low Impact because it requires a user to run an untrusted/malicious Vim command. Untrusted Vim scripts should never be run as they can already execute arbitrary shell commands. The security issue raised by this flaw would be no worse than what is already possible when running untrusted Vim scripts.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
