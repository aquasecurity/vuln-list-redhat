    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the crun container runtime. In affected versions, a malicious container image could trick the krun handler into escaping the root filesystem, allowing file creation or modification on the host. No special permissions are needed; only the ability for the current user to write to the target file is required. \n            STATEMENT: krun and krun handler is unavailable in either OCP or RHEL, it is only usable within Fedora so no Red Hat Products are affected by this CVE.\n\n\nThis vulnerability marked as high severity rather than moderate because it allows an attacker with minimal privileges—only the ability to build and run a container—to escape the root filesystem and modify files on the host. This effectively breaks container isolation, a core security boundary in containerized environments.\n\nThis flaw can be exploited remotely in shared environments where untrusted users can deploy containers. The ability to create or modify arbitrary files on the host could lead to privilege escalation, data corruption, or persistence mechanisms for further exploitation.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
