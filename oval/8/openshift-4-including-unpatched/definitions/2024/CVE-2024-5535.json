    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in OpenSSL. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure through the SSL_select_next_proto function. This flaw allows an attacker to cause unexpected application behavior or a crash by exploiting the buffer overread condition when the function is called with a zero-length client list. This issue is only exploitable if the application is misconfigured to use a zero-length server list and mishandles the 'no overlap' response in ALPN or uses the output as the opportunistic protocol in NPN. \n            STATEMENT: The FIPS modules in versions 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.",
