    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Git. When cloning, fetching, or pushing from a server, informational or error messages are transported from the remote Git process to the client via a sideband channel. These messages are prefixed with \"remote:\" and printed directly to the standard error output. Typically, this standard error output is connected to a terminal that understands ANSI escape sequences, which Git did not protect against. Most modern terminals support control sequences that can be used by a malicious actor to hide and misrepresent information or to mislead the user into executing untrusted scripts. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is classified as moderate rather than important because it primarily affects informational messages rather than directly compromising repository integrity or executing arbitrary code. The issue arises from Git's failure to sanitize ANSI escape sequences in messages received over the sideband channel, which could allow a malicious remote repository to manipulate terminal output. However, exploitation requires user interaction, such as manually copying and executing misleading commands. Unlike higher-severity vulnerabilities, this does not provide direct unauthorized access, remote code execution, or privilege escalation, limiting its overall impact. The risk is further mitigated by best practices, such as avoiding recursive clones from untrusted sources.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
