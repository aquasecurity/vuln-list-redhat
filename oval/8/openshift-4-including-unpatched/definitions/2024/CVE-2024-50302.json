    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's driver for Human Interface Devices. This flaw allows an attacker with physical access to the system to use a malicious input device to read information from the report buffer. This could be used to leak kernel memory, enabling the exploitation of additional vulnerabilities. \n            STATEMENT: This CVE marked as important vulnerability because it involves the uninitialized use of memory in the HID core subsystem, which can lead to kernel memory disclosure. Since HID reports are processed in various contexts, including user-space interactions with input devices, an attacker with the ability to craft malicious HID reports could potentially extract sensitive kernel data. This poses a significant risk in scenarios where HID devices are dynamically connected, such as USB-based attack vectors.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
