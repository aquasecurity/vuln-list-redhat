    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Go. The net/http module mishandles specific server responses from HTTP/1.1 client requests. This issue may render a connection invalid and cause a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: An attacker would need to control a malicious server and induce a client to connect to it, requiring some amount of preparation outside of the attacker's control. This reduces the severity score of this flaw to Moderate.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
