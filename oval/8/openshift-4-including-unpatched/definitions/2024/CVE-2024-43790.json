    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in the VIM package. When performing a search and displaying the search count message is disabled, the search pattern is shown at the bottom of the screen, and this text is stored in an internal buffer. The search pattern is reversed when using the right-left search mode, and a new internal buffer will be created. If the original search pattern contains NULL characters, the newly allocated buffer will be smaller than the required size, leading to a head-based out-of-bounds read. This flaw allows an attacker to trick the user into running the malicious search pattern and execute all the steps required to cause the out-of-bounds read. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a Low security impact because the \"victim\" has to run an untrusted file IN SCRIPT MODE. Someone who is running untrusted files in script mode is equivalent to someone just taking a random Python script and running it.\n\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
