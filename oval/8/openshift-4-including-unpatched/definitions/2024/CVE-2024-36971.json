    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's network route management. This flaw allows an attacker to alter the behavior of certain network connections. \n            STATEMENT: Environments which use third-party KABI modules may experience kernel crashes after applying errata for CVE-2024-36971. Contact your module vendor about an update. Until these third party modules can be fixed, you can prevent crashes by disabling them. This problem stems from modules which use the `negative_advice()` function.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
