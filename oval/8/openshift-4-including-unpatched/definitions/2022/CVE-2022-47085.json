    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in print_panic function in the repo_checkout_filter.rs in ostree. By sending a specially crafted request, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw is triggered by  handling malicious input (via the print_panic function) causing denial of service, where the overall impact is considered minimal.\n\nThe ostree versions as distributed with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 are not vulnerable to this flaw as further analysis showed both Red Hat Enterprise Linux were already shipping ostree 2022.7 which already contained the changes to eliminate this vulnerability from the code base. Additionally the vulnerable code path is not exposed to any attacker controlled input, closing the attack surface involved in this CVE.",
