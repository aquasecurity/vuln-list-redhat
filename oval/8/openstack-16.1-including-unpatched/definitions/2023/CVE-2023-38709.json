    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in httpd. The response headers are not sanitized before an HTTP response is sent when a malicious backend can insert a Content-Type, Content-Encoding, or some other headers, resulting in an HTTP response splitting. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw is only exploitable by a malicious backend or a malicious application, but may also affect forward proxy configurations.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
