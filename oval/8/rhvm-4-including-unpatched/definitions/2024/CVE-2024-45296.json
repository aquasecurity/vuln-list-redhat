    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in path-to-regexp package, where it turns path strings into regular expressions. In certain cases, path-to-regexp will output a regular expression that can be exploited to cause poor performance. Because JavaScript is single-threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and lead to a denial of service (DoS). \n            \n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
