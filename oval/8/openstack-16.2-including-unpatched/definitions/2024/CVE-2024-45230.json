    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Python's Django urlize() and urlizetrunc() functions. Excessive input with a specific sequence of characters may lead to denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: CVE-2024-45230 is classified as a moderate severity vulnerability because, while it presents a potential denial-of-service (DoS) risk, it does not directly expose the application to data breaches or arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability arises from inefficient handling of very large inputs with specific character sequences in the `urlize()` and `urlizetrunc()` functions. However, the attack requires carefully crafted input and only leads to resource exhaustion (such as CPU or memory overload) under specific conditions, making it less likely to be exploited in typical production environments. This reduces its impact compared to vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized access or significant system compromise, hence the moderate severity rating.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
