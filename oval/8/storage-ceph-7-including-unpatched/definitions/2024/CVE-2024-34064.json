    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in jinja2. The `xmlattr` filter accepts keys containing non-attribute characters. XML/HTML attributes cannot contain spaces, `/`, `\u003e`, or `=`, as each would then be interpreted as starting a separate attribute. If an application accepts keys (as opposed to only values) as user input, and renders these in pages that other users see as well, an attacker could inject other attributes and perform cross-site scripting (XSS). \n            STATEMENT: The fix for CVE-2024-22195 only addressed spaces, not other characters. Accepting keys as user input is now explicitly considered an unintended use case of the `xmlattr` filter, and code that does so without otherwise validating the input should be flagged as insecure, regardless of Jinja version. Accepting _values_ as user input continues to be safe.\n            MITIGATION: Do not accept user input as keys to the xmlattr filter without validation. See the statement above for more information.",
