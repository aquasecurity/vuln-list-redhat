    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the NPM package `micromatch` where it is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS). The issue occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will readily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
