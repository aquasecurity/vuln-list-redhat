    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A DOM Clobbering vulnerability was found in Webpack via `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`. DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script through seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage, for example, through a post or comment, and leverages the gadgets (pieces of JS code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. This vulnerability can lead to Cross-site scripting (XSS) on websites that include Webpack-generated files and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags with improperly sanitized name or ID attributes. \n            STATEMENT: The severity of this issue is classified as moderate rather than important due to the specific conditions required for exploitation. DOM Clobbering, while serious, can only be leveraged in environments where an attacker has the ability to inject unsanitized HTML attributes (e.g., `name` or `id`) into a web page. This limits the attack surface to applications that improperly sanitize user input and rely on Webpack-generated files. Furthermore, the exploitation depends on existing vulnerabilities in the sanitization process, rather than the direct execution of arbitrary scripts. As a result, while the issue can lead to XSS, its impact is constrained by the contextual requirement of HTML injection, lowering its overall severity compared to more direct XSS vectors.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
