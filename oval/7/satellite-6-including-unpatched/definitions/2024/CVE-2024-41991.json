    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: An issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.8 and 4.2 before 4.2.15. The urlize and urlizetrunc template filters, and the AdminURLFieldWidget widget, are subject to a potential denial-of-service attack via certain inputs with a very large number of Unicode characters. \n            STATEMENT: The identified vulnerability in Django's urlize, urlizetrunc template filters, and the AdminURLFieldWidget widget is classified as moderate severity rather than important due to its specific attack vector and impact. While the flaw allows for a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack via inputs with a large number of Unicode characters, exploiting this vulnerability requires a significant volume of data to be processed by these components, which is a non-trivial task. Additionally, standard mitigation measures such as input validation, rate limiting, and monitoring can effectively reduce the risk.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
