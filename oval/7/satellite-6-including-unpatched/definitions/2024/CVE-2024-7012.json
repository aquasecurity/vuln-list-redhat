    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified in Foreman when deployed with External Authentication, due to the puppet-foreman configuration. This issue arises from Apache's mod_proxy not properly unsetting headers because of restrictions on underscores in HTTP headers, allowing authentication through a malformed header. This flaw impacts all active Satellite deployments (6.13, 6.14 and 6.15) and could potentially enable unauthorized users to gain administrative access. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is rated as CRITICAL severity because this flaw allows attackers to gain unauthorized administrative access.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
