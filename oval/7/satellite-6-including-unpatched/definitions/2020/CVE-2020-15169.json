    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in rubygem-actionview in versions prior to 5.2.4.4 and 6.0.3.3. When an HTML-unsafe string is passed as the default for a missing  translation key, the default string is incorrectly marked as HTML-safe and not escaped. Thie highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat CloudForms and Red Hat Satellite 6 ships affected ActiveView RubyGem, however, those are not vulnerable since product code do not use such unsafe implementation.",
