    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the golang standard library, io/fs. Calling Glob on a path that contains a large number of path separators can cause a panic issue due to stack exhaustion. This could allow an attacker to impact availability. \n            STATEMENT: RH ProdSec has set the Impact of this vulnerability to Moderate as there is no known method to execute arbitary code. Successful exploitation of this bug can cause the application under attack to panic, merely causing a Denial of Service at the application level. As the kernel is unaffected by this bug, the user can merely relaunch the application to fix the problem. Also, if somehow the application keeps relaunching, the timer watchdogs in the default RHEL kernel will stop the attack in its tracks.",
