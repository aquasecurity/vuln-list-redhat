    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Werkzeug, where an attacker may be able to execute code on a developer's machine under some circumstances. This issue requires the attacker to get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control and enter the debugger PIN; if they are successful, it allows access to the debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires the attacker to guess a URL in the developer's application that will trigger the debugger. \n            STATEMENT: Werkzeug's debugger allows an attacker to potentially execute code on a developer's machine. This can occur if the attacker tricks the developer into interacting with a controlled domain and subdomain and entering the debugger PIN. Although the debugger is meant to run locally, successful exploitation can give the attacker access to it by guessing a specific URL that triggers the debugger. The severity is rate as IMPORTANT because this flaw can potentially impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability if the attacker can gain control.\n\nCeph uses an affected Werkzeug version but this vulnerability does not impact OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) because the debugger is not set up or used on development machines, so there is no debugger to have information taken from.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
