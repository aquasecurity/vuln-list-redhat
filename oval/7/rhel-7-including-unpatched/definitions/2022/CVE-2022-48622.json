    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in GNOME's GdkPixbuf library, a library used to load image data in various formats used by GDK for handling graphical assets. This issue occurs when loading a crafted ANI (animated cursor file) file, which may lead to a heap based out-of-bounds write, causing memory corruption. When a successful attack is in place, it can lead to a denial of service or in some cases arbitrary code execution. \n            STATEMENT: The vulnerability in the GdkPixbuf library, allowing for heap-based out-of-bounds writes when loading crafted ANI files, poses a moderate severity risk. While the flaw could lead to memory corruption and potential denial of service or arbitrary code execution, its impact is somewhat mitigated by factors such as the need for the attacker to craft specifically malicious ANI files and the requirement for user interaction to open these files. Additionally, exploitation is limited to systems where GdkPixbuf is used to handle ANI files, reducing the overall attack surface.\n            MITIGATION: This flaw can be mitigated by the user avoiding to load .ani files from untrusted sources.",
