    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the python-idna library. A malicious argument was sent to the idna.encode() function can trigger an uncontrolled resource consumption, resulting in a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: The vulnerability in the idna.encode() function, allowing for resource consumption via specially crafted arguments, is categorized as a moderate severity issue due to its potential impact on system availability rather than data integrity or confidentiality. While the vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition, it requires the passing of unusually large or maliciously crafted inputs to exploit. Normal usage scenarios typically do not encounter such inputs.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
