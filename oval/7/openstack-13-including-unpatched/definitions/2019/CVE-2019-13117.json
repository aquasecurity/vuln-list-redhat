    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The CVE program describes this issue as: In numbers.c in libxslt 1.1.33, an xsl:number with certain format strings could lead to a uninitialized read in xsltNumberFormatInsertNumbers. This could allow an attacker to discern whether a byte on the stack contains the characters A, a, I, i, or 0, or any other character. \n            STATEMENT: RH ProdSec scores this vulnerability as \"Low\" due to complex prerequisites for successful exploitation.\n\n* The attacker must be able to supply an XSLT file to a system that automatically processes it using libxslt.\n* An xsl:number element must be present with a malformed format string designed to cause an uninitialized read in xsltNumberFormatInsertNumbers.\n* While a successful exploitation will force libxslt to process memory content as if it were a format string, the attacker cannot directly control memory contents but can observe differences in output to infer values.\n\n* This issue affects the version of libxslt as shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3, as it includes the affected code which allows uninitialized read.\n* Red Hat OpenStack Platform versions 9, 10, 13, \u0026 14 are marked WONTFIX as they will inherit fixes from the underlying RHEL layer.",
