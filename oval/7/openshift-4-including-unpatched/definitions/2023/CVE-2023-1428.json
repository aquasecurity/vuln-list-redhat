    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the gRPC library. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a reachable assertion, causing the abort function to be called and resulting in a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is specific to the C++, Python and Ruby implementations of gRPC prior to the 1.53 release.\nThe gRPC library was packaged with Openshift via the Kuryr component. However, Kuryr was never configured to run code using the gRPC library and has since been removed.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
