    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in grub2. During the network boot process, when trying to search for the configuration file, grub copies data from a user controlled environment variable into an internal buffer using the grub_strcpy() function. During this step, it fails to consider the environment variable length when allocating the internal buffer, resulting in an out-of-bounds write. If correctly exploited, this issue may result in remote code execution through the same network segment grub is searching for the boot information, which can be used to by-pass secure boot protections. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security team has rated this vulnerability as Important, as an attacker that has access to the same network segment is able to exploit it once netboot is enabled in grub2.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
