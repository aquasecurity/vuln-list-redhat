    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A timing side-channel vulnerability was found in OpenSSL. This vulnerability allows an attacker to recover the private key. However, measuring the timing would require local access to the signing application or a fast network connection with low latency. There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This issue can happen with significant probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular, the NIST P-521 curve is affected. \n            STATEMENT: To be able to measure this leak, the attacker process must be located in the same physical computer or must have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason, the impact of this vulnerability is rated as Low.",
