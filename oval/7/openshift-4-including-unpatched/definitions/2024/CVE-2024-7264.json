    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in libcurl, where libcurl's ASN1 parser code has the `GTime2str()` function, used for parsing an ASN.1 Generalized Time field. If a syntactically incorrect field is given, the parser can use -1 for the length of the *time fraction*, leading to a `strlen()` performed on a pointer to a heap buffer area that is not purposely NULL terminated. \n            STATEMENT: The vulnerability is classified as low severity because it primarily results in a heap buffer over-read rather than a direct memory corruption or code execution risk. Since the ASN.1 parsing occurs after a successful TLS handshake, the malformed certificate must first bypass the TLS library's validation, which significantly reduces the likelihood of exploitation. \n\nAdditionally, the impact is limited to a potential crash or unintended heap data exposure through CURLINFO_CERTINFO, but not arbitrary code execution. The requirement for a specific TLS backend configuration and the controlled nature of the memory read further minimize its exploitability.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
