    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in BIND 9. By flooding a target resolver with HTTP/2 traffic and exploiting this flaw, an attacker could overwhelm the server, causing high CPU and/or memory usage and preventing other clients from establishing DoH connections. This issue could significantly impair the resolver's performance and effectively deny legitimate clients access to the DNS resolution service. \n            \n            MITIGATION: If the feature is not needed, disable DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) in your bind config. Otherwise, we recommend upgrading to a patched version of bind.",
