    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: An issue was discovered in libexpat before 2.6.3. dtdCopy in xmlparse.c can have an integer overflow for nDefaultAtts on 32-bit platforms (where UINT_MAX equals SIZE_MAX). \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is classified as moderate severity rather than important due to its reliance on specific conditions for exploitation. The integer overflow in dtdCopy affecting nDefaultAtts is limited to 32-bit platforms, reducing the attack surface as many modern systems operate on 64-bit architectures. Additionally, while the impact can lead to denial of service and potentially arbitrary code execution, the latter requires precise manipulation of the overflow condition, which may be non-trivial for attackers to achieve reliably. The constrained platform scope and the complexity of exploitation lower the overall severity, though it still poses a risk in environments where 32-bit systems are prevalent.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
