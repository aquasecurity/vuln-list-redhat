    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in rsync. It could allow a server to enumerate the contents of an arbitrary file from the client's machine. This issue occurs when files are being copied from a client to a server. During this process, the rsync server will send checksums of local data to the client to compare with in order to determine what data needs to be sent to the server. By sending specially constructed checksum values for arbitrary files, an attacker may be able to reconstruct the data of those files byte-by-byte based on the responses from the client. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability marked as moderate rather than important because it requires the attacker to control the rsync server, which limits the scope of exploitation to scenarios where the client interacts with untrusted or compromised servers. Additionally, the attack is non-trivial, as it relies on the attacker sending specially crafted checksum values and deducing file contents byte-by-byte based on the clientâ€™s responses. This makes the exploit more complex and time-consuming compared to direct file access vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the impact is limited to file data enumeration, and it does not allow arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation on the client.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
