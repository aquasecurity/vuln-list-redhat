    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in Curl. When curl is told to use the Certificate Status Request TLS extension, often referred to as OCSP stapling, to verify that the server certificate is valid, it might fail to detect some OCSP problems and incorrectly consider the response as fine instead. If the returned status reports an error other than \"revoked\", such as \"unauthorized\", it is not treated as a bad certificate. \n            STATEMENT: The vulnerability in curl related to OCSP stapling is classified as moderate severity rather than important because it only affects the validation of server certificates under specific conditions: when using the GnuTLS library and when the OCSP response indicates an error other than \"revoked\", such as \"unauthorized\". This limits the attack surface, as the issue does not result in outright failure to detect revoked certificates, arguably the most critical OCSP check. Additionally, OCSP stapling is not widely implemented across the web, reducing the likelihood of widespread exploitation.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
