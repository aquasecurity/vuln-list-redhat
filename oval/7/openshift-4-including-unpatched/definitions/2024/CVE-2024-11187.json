    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the bind package where a crafted DNS zone may generate numerous records in the 'Additional' section of the response. This flaw allows an attacker to send a large amount of such queries, which may lead either the authoritative server or an independent resolver to run into an uncontrolled CPU resource scenario, ultimately resulting in the server not being able to attend new requests and causing a denial of service as a consequence. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Users can set the option `minimal-responses yes;`in the configuration file located at `/etc/named.conf`to mitigate this vulnerability.",
