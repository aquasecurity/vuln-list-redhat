    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A path traversal vulnerability exists in rsync. It stems from behavior enabled by the `--inc-recursive` option, a default-enabled option for many client options and can be enabled by the server even if not explicitly enabled by the client. When using the `--inc-recursive` option, a lack of proper symlink verification coupled with deduplication checks occurring on a per-file-list basis could allow a server to write files outside of the client's intended destination directory. A malicious server could write malicious files to arbitrary locations named after valid directories/paths on the client. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat rates this flaw to have moderate severity as it depends on specific configurations for the attack to succeed, symbolic link syncing must be  enabled (explicitly by providing the `--links` option or implicitly such as with `--archive`) and the client must connect to a malicious or compromised server.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
