    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the encoding/gob package of the Golang standard library. Calling Decoder.Decoding, a message that contains deeply nested structures, can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion. This is a follow-up to CVE-2022-30635. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in Go's `encoding/gob` package is of high severity because it exposes applications to potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks through stack exhaustion. Since `gob` relies on recursive function calls to decode nested structures, an attacker could exploit this by sending crafted messages with excessively deep nesting, causing the application to panic due to stack overflow. This risk is particularly important in scenarios where untrusted or external input is processed, as it can lead to system unavailability or crashes, undermining the reliability and availability of services.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
