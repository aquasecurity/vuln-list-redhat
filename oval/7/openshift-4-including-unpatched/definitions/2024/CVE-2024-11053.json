    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in libcurl. When .netrc is used to follow with HTTP redirects, curl could leak the password used for the first host to the followed-to host under some circumstances. For example: A curl transfer with `a.com` that redirects to `b.com` that uses a `.netrc` with a match but no password specified for the second host would make curl pass on `alicespassword` as the password even in the second transfer to the separate host `b.com`. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Currently, no mitigation is available for this vulnerability.",
