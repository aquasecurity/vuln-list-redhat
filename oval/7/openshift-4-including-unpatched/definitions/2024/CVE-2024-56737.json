    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the HFS file system driver in grub2. This issue allows a local attacker to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted sblock in a malicious HFS file system, causing memory corruption, unexpected behavior, and denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: To exploit this flaw, an attacker needs to trick a user into running grub2 with a specially crafted HFS file system image, limiting the exposure of this flaw. For this reason, this vulnerability has been rated with a Moderate severity.\n            MITIGATION: Do not run grub2 in an untrusted environment, specifically with a HFS file system image.",
