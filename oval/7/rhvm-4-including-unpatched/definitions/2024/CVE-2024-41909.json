    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Apache MINA SSHD. This flaw allows an attacker who can intercept traffic between the client and server to drop certain packets from the stream. This potentially causes a Terrapin attack where the client and server consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled. \n            STATEMENT: Above CVE is classified as a moderate severity issue rather than an important one due to its reliance on specific conditions for exploitation. The vulnerability, known as a Terrapin attack, requires an attacker to have the capability to intercept and manipulate packets between the SSH client and server. This level of access is not commonly available in most network environments, reducing the likelihood of widespread exploitation. Additionally, the impact of the attack—where security features may be downgraded or disabled—depends on the attacker's ability to perform packet drops without detection, which further limits the potential for significant damage.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
