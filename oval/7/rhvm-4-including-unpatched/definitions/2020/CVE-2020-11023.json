    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in jQuery. HTML containing \\\u003coption\\\u003e elements from untrusted sources are passed, even after sanitizing, to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods, which may execute untrusted code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 6, 7, and 8 ship a vulnerable version of JQuery in the `pcs` component. As PCS does not accept untrusted input, the vulnerable code cannot be controlled by an attacker.\n\nMultiple Red Hat offerings use doxygen to build documentation. During this process an affected jquery.js file can be included in the resulting package. The 'gcc' and 'tbb' packages were potentially vulnerable via this method.\n\nOpenShift Container Platform 4 is not affected because even though it uses the 'gcc' component, vulnerable code is limited within the libstdc++-docs rpm package, which is not shipped.",
