    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Tomcat. A Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition occurs during JSP compilation on case-insensitive file systems when the default servlet is enabled for writing. This vulnerability allows an uploaded file to be treated as a JSP and executed, resulting in remote code execution. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw can only be exploited when the `readonly` initialization parameter value is set to `false`, when running on case insensitive file systems and when the application is under load, specifically when read and upload operations are performed on the same file simultaneously.\n\nThe default `readonly` initialization parameter value is `true` and not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nDue to the conditions for this issue to be exploited, especially because it requires unlikely configurations, this flaw has been rated with a Moderate severity.\n\nThe Tomcat package as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 is not affected by this vulnerability because the vulnerable code was introduced in a newer Tomcat version.\n\nRed Hat Satellite is not directed impacted by this issue as it does not include the affected Tomcat package. However, Tomcat is consumed by Candlepin, a component of Satellite. Red Hat Satellite users are advised to check the impact state of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as any necessary fixes will be distributed through the platform.\n            MITIGATION: Consider setting the readonly initialization parameter value to true (the default value), if that is not possible, do not use a case-insensitive file system.",
