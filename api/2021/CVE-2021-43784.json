  "statement": "Before runC 1.0.3, the only user-controlled byte array (used to exploit this vulnerability) was the namespace paths attributes, located in runC's config.json. Having raw access to that setting would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely. This issue means that in practice, it was fairly difficult to specify an arbitrary-length netlink message with most container runtimes, resulting in the impact of this vulnerability being Low.",

  "name": "CVE-2021-43784",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.",
    "An integer overflow vulnerability was found in runC. This issue occurs due to an incorrect netlink encoder handling the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type. This flaw allows an attacker who can include a large enough malicious byte array attribute to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their netlink payload, which disables all namespaces."
