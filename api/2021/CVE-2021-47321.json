    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nwatchdog: Fix possible use-after-free by calling del_timer_sync()\nThis driver's remove path calls del_timer(). However, that function\ndoes not wait until the timer handler finishes. This means that the\ntimer handler may still be running after the driver's remove function\nhas finished, which would result in a use-after-free.\nFix by calling del_timer_sync(), which makes sure the timer handler\nhas finished, and unable to re-schedule itself.",
    "A vulnerability was found  in the del_timer() function in the Linux kernel's watchdog driver. This issue occurs because the function does not wait for the timer handler to finish, which may lead to a situation where the handler runs after the driver that has been removed, causing a use-after-free issue."
