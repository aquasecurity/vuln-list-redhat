  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "GNOME GdkPixbuf (aka GDK-PixBuf) before 2.42.8 allows a heap-based buffer overflow when compositing or clearing frames in GIF files, as demonstrated by io-gif-animation.c composite_frame. This overflow is controllable and could be abused for code execution, especially on 32-bit systems.",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in GNOME GdkPixbuf (aka GDK-PixBuf) when compositing or clearing frames in GIF files. The vulnerability exists due to a boundary error when processing GIF images. This flaw allows an attacker to create a specially crafted GIF image, trick the victim into opening it, triggering an out-of-bounds write, which allows executing arbitrary code on the target system or causing a potential crash."
