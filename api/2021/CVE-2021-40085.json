    "An issue was discovered in OpenStack Neutron before 16.4.1, 17.x before 17.2.1, and 18.x before 18.1.1. Authenticated attackers can reconfigure dnsmasq via a crafted extra_dhcp_opts value.",
    "An input-validation flaw was found in openstack-neutron, where an authenticated attacker could change the dnsmasq configuration. By crafting extra_dhcp_opts values, the attacker could crash the dnsmasq, change parameters for tenants sharing the same interface, or otherwise alter that daemonâ€™s behavior. This flaw might also be used to trigger a configuration parsing buffer overflow in versions of dnsmasq prior to 2.81. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability, but also threatens data confidentiality and integrity."
