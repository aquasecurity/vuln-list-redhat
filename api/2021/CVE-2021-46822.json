  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The PPM reader in libjpeg-turbo through 2.0.90 mishandles use of tjLoadImage for loading a 16-bit binary PPM file into a grayscale buffer and loading a 16-bit binary PGM file into an RGB buffer. This is related to a heap-based buffer overflow in the get_word_rgb_row function in rdppm.c.",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in libjpeg-turbo in the get_word_rgb_row() function in rdppm.c. The flaw occurs when the PPM reader in libjpeg-turbo mishandles use of the tjLoadImage() function for loading a 16-bit binary PPM file into a grayscale uncompressed image buffer and then loading a 16-bit binary PGM file into an RGB uncompressed image buffer. This flaw allows a remote attacker to persuade a victim to open a specially-crafted file, causing the application to crash."
