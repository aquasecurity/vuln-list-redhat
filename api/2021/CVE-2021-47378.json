    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnvme-rdma: destroy cm id before destroy qp to avoid use after free\nWe should always destroy cm_id before destroy qp to avoid to get cma\nevent after qp was destroyed, which may lead to use after free.\nIn RDMA connection establishment error flow, don't destroy qp in cm\nevent handler.Just report cm_error to upper level, qp will be destroy\nin nvme_rdma_alloc_queue() after destroy cm id.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's nvme-rdma driver where the driver failed to destroy a component cm_id before another component qp was destroyed. This issue occurs when the kernel incorrectly manages memory during RDMA, leading to a potential use-after-free."
