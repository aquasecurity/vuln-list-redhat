    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nblock: don't call rq_qos_ops-\u003edone_bio if the bio isn't tracked\nrq_qos framework is only applied on request based driver, so:\n1) rq_qos_done_bio() needn't to be called for bio based driver\n2) rq_qos_done_bio() needn't to be called for bio which isn't tracked,\nsuch as bios ended from error handling code.\nEspecially in bio_endio():\n1) request queue is referred via bio-\u003ebi_bdev-\u003ebd_disk-\u003equeue, which\nmay be gone since request queue refcount may not be held in above two\ncases\n2) q-\u003erq_qos may be freed in blk_cleanup_queue() when calling into\n__rq_qos_done_bio()\nFix the potential kernel panic by not calling rq_qos_ops-\u003edone_bio if\nthe bio isn't tracked. This way is safe because both ioc_rqos_done_bio()\nand blkcg_iolatency_done_bio() are nop if the bio isn't tracked.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel, where improper handling of block I/O requests when a block I/O request (bio) is not tracked, the kernel erroneously calls the rq_qos_ops-\u003edone_bio function, potentially leading to use-after-free issues. This situation can occurr when the request queue is accessed after it has been freed, resulting in possible kernel panic."
