    "In lldpd before 1.0.13, when decoding SONMP packets in the sonmp_decode function, it's possible to trigger an out-of-bounds heap read via short SONMP packets.",
    "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability is present in lldpd. An attacker on the same network as the vulnerable system may use this vulnerability to leak memory data from the application or crash it by sending shorter SONMP packets than what is expected."
