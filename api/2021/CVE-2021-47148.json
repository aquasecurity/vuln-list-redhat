    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nocteontx2-pf: fix a buffer overflow in otx2_set_rxfh_context()\nThis function is called from ethtool_set_rxfh() and \"*rss_context\"\ncomes from the user.  Add some bounds checking to prevent memory\ncorruption.",
    "A vulnerability was found in octeontx2-pf driver of Linux Kernel, where a buffer overflow could occur due to insufficient bounds checking on the variable *rss_context. This could potentially lead to memory corruption. The issue has been addressed by implementing proper bounds checking to ensure that input size limits are respected, thereby preventing buffer overflows and enhancing system security within the octeontx2-pf driver."
