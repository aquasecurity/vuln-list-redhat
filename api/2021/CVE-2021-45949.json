    "Ghostscript GhostPDL 9.50 through 9.54.0 has a heap-based buffer overflow in sampled_data_finish (called from sampled_data_continue and interp).",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in Ghostscript’s GhostPDL in the sampled_data_finish function (called from sampled_data_continue and interp). This flaw allows a local attacker to pass a specially crafted malicious file to Ghostscript that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially causing a crash that leads to a denial of service."
