    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nmISDN: fix possible use-after-free in HFC_cleanup()\nThis module's remove path calls del_timer(). However, that function\ndoes not wait until the timer handler finishes. This means that the\ntimer handler may still be running after the driver's remove function\nhas finished, which would result in a use-after-free.\nFix by calling del_timer_sync(), which makes sure the timer handler\nhas finished, and unable to re-schedule itself.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's mISDN driver. This issue arises during the cleanup process, where a timer handler might still be running after the driver has been removed, which can lead to a use-after-free issue, potentially causing a system crash."
