  "details": [
    "An attacker-controlled pointer free in Busybox's hush applet leads to denial of service and possible code execution when processing a crafted shell command, due to the shell mishandling the \u0026\u0026\u0026 string. This may be used for remote code execution under rare conditions of filtered command input.",
    "A flaw was found in BusyBox, where it did not properly sanitize while processing a crafted shell command, leading to a denial of service and possible code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
