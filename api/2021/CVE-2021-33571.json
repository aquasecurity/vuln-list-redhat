    "In Django 2.2 before 2.2.24, 3.x before 3.1.12, and 3.2 before 3.2.4, URLValidator, validate_ipv4_address, and validate_ipv46_address do not prohibit leading zero characters in octal literals. This may allow a bypass of access control that is based on IP addresses. (validate_ipv4_address and validate_ipv46_address are unaffected with Python 3.9.5+..) .",
    "A flaw was found in django. Leading zeros in octal literals aren't prohibited in IP addresses. If you used such values you could suffer from indeterminate SSRF, RFI, and LFI attacks. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity."
