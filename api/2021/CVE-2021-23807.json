    "This affects the package jsonpointer before 5.0.0. A type confusion vulnerability can lead to a bypass of a previous Prototype Pollution fix when the pointer components are arrays.",
    "A Type Confusion vulnerability was found in node-jsonpointer. This issue leads to the bypass of a previous Prototype Pollution fix when the pointer components are arrays. This flaw allows an attacker to use objects of incompatible base types, leading to remote code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
