  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) in PHP before 5.2.13 does not provide the expected entropy, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to guess values that were intended to be unpredictable, as demonstrated by session cookies generated by using the uniqid function."
