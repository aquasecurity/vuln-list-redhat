  "statement": "The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and 5 did not\ninclude CAN bus subsystem support, and therefore are not affected by this\nissue. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise MRG via https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0330.html. A future kernel update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.",

  "details": [
    "The bcm_connect function in net/can/bcm.c (aka the Broadcast Manager) in the Controller Area Network (CAN) implementation in the Linux kernel 2.6.36 and earlier creates a publicly accessible file with a filename containing a kernel memory address, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information about kernel memory use by listing this filename."
