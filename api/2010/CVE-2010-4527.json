  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The load_mixer_volumes function in sound/oss/soundcard.c in the OSS sound subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.37 incorrectly expects that a certain name field ends with a '\\0' character, which allows local users to conduct buffer overflow attacks and gain privileges, or possibly obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, via a SOUND_MIXER_SETLEVELS ioctl call."
