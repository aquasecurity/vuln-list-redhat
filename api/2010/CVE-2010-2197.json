  "statement": "We do not consider this to be a security issue as it does not introduce any additional risk in using untrusted RPM .spec files.  RPM .spec files can do a lot of things, regardless of how rpmbuild parses the syntax, because certain sections of the .spec file (%prep, %build, etc.) are treated as shell scripts.  Because of the ability to easily include malicious commands anywhere, an untrusted .spec file should be carefully examined prior to building, the same as if you were to download and execute an untrusted shell script.",

  "details": [
    "rpmbuild in RPM 4.8.0 and earlier does not properly parse the syntax of spec files, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to remove home directories via vectors involving a ;~ (semicolon tilde) sequence in a Name tag."
