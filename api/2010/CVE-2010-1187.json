A future kernel update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 may address this flaw.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) functionality in Linux kernel 2.6.16-rc1 through 2.6.33, and possibly other versions, allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel OOPS) by sending datagrams through AF_TIPC before entering network mode, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference."
