  "statement": "This issue did not affected Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 due to the lack of localization in lppasswd as provided in those releases.\nThe affected code is present in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, however lppasswd is not shipped setuid so is not vulnerable to this issue. If a user were to enable the setuid bit on lppasswd, the impact would only be a crash of lppasswd due to use of FORTIFY_SOURCE protections. Therefore, there are no plans to correct this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.",

  "details": [
    "The _cupsGetlang function, as used by lppasswd.c in lppasswd in CUPS 1.2.2, 1.3.7, 1.3.9, and 1.4.1, relies on an environment variable to determine the file that provides localized message strings, which allows local users to gain privileges via a file that contains crafted localization data with format string specifiers."
