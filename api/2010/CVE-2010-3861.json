  "details": [
    "The ethtool_get_rxnfc function in net/core/ethtool.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36 does not initialize a certain block of heap memory, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information via an ETHTOOL_GRXCLSRLALL ethtool command with a large info.rule_cnt value, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2478."
