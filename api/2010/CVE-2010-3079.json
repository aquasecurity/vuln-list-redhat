  "statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and 5, as they do not include support for Ftrace. It did not affect Red Hat Enterprise MRG as it did not contain the upstream commit 8fc0c701 that introduced this flaw.",

  "details": [
    "kernel/trace/ftrace.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.35.5, when debugfs is enabled, does not properly handle interaction between mutex possession and llseek operations, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and outage of all function tracing files) via an lseek call on a file descriptor associated with the set_ftrace_filter file."
