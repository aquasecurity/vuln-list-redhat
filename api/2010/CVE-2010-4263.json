  "statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they did not include support for PCI I/O Virtualization (IOV). Future updates in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 may address this flaw.",

  "details": [
    "The igb_receive_skb function in drivers/net/igb/igb_main.c in the Intel Gigabit Ethernet (aka igb) subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.34, when Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) and promiscuous mode are enabled but no VLANs are registered, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) and possibly have unspecified other impact via a VLAN tagged frame."
