  "details": [
    "The do_tcp_setsockopt function in net/ipv4/tcp.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.37-rc2 does not properly restrict TCP_MAXSEG (aka MSS) values, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS) via a setsockopt call that specifies a small value, leading to a divide-by-zero error or incorrect use of a signed integer."
