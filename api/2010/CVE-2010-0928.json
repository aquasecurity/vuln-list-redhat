  "statement": "CVE-2010-0928 describes a fault-based attack on OpenSSL where an attacker has precise control over the target system environment in order to be able to introduce faults through power supply manipulation.\nThe attack is not a viable threat to OpenSSL as used in Red Hat products. The Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having low security impact and we do not intend to issue updates to address it.",

  "details": [
    "OpenSSL 0.9.8i on the Gaisler Research LEON3 SoC on the Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA uses a Fixed Width Exponentiation (FWE) algorithm for certain signature calculations, and does not verify the signature before providing it to a caller, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to determine the private key via a modified supply voltage for the microprocessor, related to a \"fault-based attack.\""
