  "statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4, as they do not include support for sys_move_pages. It was only introduced in kernel version 2.6.18 onwards. This issue was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG via https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0147.html and https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0161.html.",

  "name": "CVE-2010-0415",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The do_pages_move function in mm/migrate.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.33-rc7 does not validate node values, which allows local users to read arbitrary kernel memory locations, cause a denial of service (OOPS), and possibly have unspecified other impact by specifying a node that is not part of the kernel's node set."
