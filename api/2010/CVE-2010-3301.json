  "details": [
    "The IA32 system call emulation functionality in arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36-rc4-git2 on the x86_64 platform does not zero extend the %eax register after the 32-bit entry path to ptrace is used, which allows local users to gain privileges by triggering an out-of-bounds access to the system call table using the %rax register.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a CVE-2007-4573 regression."
