    "stonith-ng in pacemaker and cluster-glue passed passwords as commandline parameters, making it possible for local attackers to gain access to passwords of the HA stack and potentially influence its operations. This is fixed in cluster-glue 1.0.6 and newer, and pacemaker 1.1.3 and newer.",
    "A flaw was found in cluster-glue, where the stonith-ng function in cluster-glue passed passwords as command line parameters. This flaw allows local attackers to gain access to passwords of the HA stack and potentially influence its operations. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
