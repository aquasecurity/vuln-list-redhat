  "details": [
    "GNU Wget 1.12 and earlier uses a server-provided filename instead of the original URL to determine the destination filename of a download, which allows remote servers to create or overwrite arbitrary files via a 3xx redirect to a URL with a .wgetrc filename followed by a 3xx redirect to a URL with a crafted filename, and possibly execute arbitrary code as a consequence of writing to a dotfile in a home directory."
