    "ISC DHCP server 4.2 before 4.2.0-P2, when configured to use failover partnerships, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (communications-interrupted state and DHCP client service loss) by connecting to a port that is only intended for a failover peer, as demonstrated by a Nagios check_tcp process check to TCP port 520."
