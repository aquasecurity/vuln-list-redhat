  "details": [
    "The irda_bind function in net/irda/af_irda.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36-rc3-next-20100901 does not properly handle failure of the irda_open_tsap function, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) and possibly have unspecified other impact via multiple unsuccessful calls to bind on an AF_IRDA (aka PF_IRDA) socket."
