  "statement": "Red Hat is aware of this issue and is tracking it via the following bug:\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/CVE-2010-3705.\nThis issue did not affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 as it did not include support for SCTP. It did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 as it did not include upstream commit 1f485649 that introduced the problem. Future kernel updates in Red Hat Enterprise MRG may address this flaw.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The sctp_auth_asoc_get_hmac function in net/sctp/auth.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36 does not properly validate the hmac_ids array of an SCTP peer, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and panic) via a crafted value in the last element of this array."
