  "details": [
    "The udp_queue_rcv_skb function in net/ipv4/udp.c in a certain Red Hat build of the Linux kernel 2.6.18 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock and system hang) by sending UDP traffic to a socket that has a crafted socket filter, a related issue to CVE-2010-4158."
