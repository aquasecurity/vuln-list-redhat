  "statement": "The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 did not include support for Packet writing layer for ATAPI and SCSI disc media devices, and therefore are not affected by this issue. The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG only allow root access to the \"/dev/pktcdvd/control\" file, and therefore are also not affected by this issue.",
