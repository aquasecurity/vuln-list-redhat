    "Multiple TCP/IP and ICMP implementations allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (network throughput reduction for TCP connections) via a blind throughput-reduction attack using spoofed Source Quench packets, aka the \"ICMP Source Quench attack.\"  NOTE: CVE-2004-0790, CVE-2004-0791, and CVE-2004-1060 have been SPLIT based on different attacks; CVE-2005-0065, CVE-2005-0066, CVE-2005-0067, and CVE-2005-0068 are related identifiers that are SPLIT based on the underlying vulnerability.  While CVE normally SPLITs based on vulnerability, the attack-based identifiers exist due to the variety and number of affected implementations and solutions that address the attacks instead of the underlying vulnerabilities."
