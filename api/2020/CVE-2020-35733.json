  "statement": "Red Hat CloudForms 5.10 ships affected erlang-OTP component but the product does not use it in a vulnerable way; therefore, the impact is low. The newer version of CloudForms 5.11 does not include the affected component.\nRed Hat Ansible Tower 3.6 ships 20.3.8.21 erlang-OTP component but this version never introduced the vulnerability, therefore is not affected. The newer versions of Red Hat Ansible Tower 3.7 and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform which ships Ansible Tower 3.8 do not include the erlang dependency.\nAll supported releases of Red Hat OpenStack Platform ship the affected Erlang component, however it is only used as a dependency for RabbitMQ and is not exposed outside the management network. As this network is tightly-regulated to OpenStack administrators, the risk for abuse is significantly reduced.",
