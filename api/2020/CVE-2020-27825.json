    "A use-after-free flaw was found in kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c in Linux kernel (before 5.10-rc1). There was a race problem in trace_open and resize of cpu buffer running parallely on different cpus, may cause a denial of service problem (DOS). This flaw could even allow a local attacker with special user privilege to a kernel information leak threat.",
