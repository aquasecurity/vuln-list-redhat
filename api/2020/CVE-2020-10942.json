Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and 8 may address this issue.\nIt is rated to have Low impact because it is quite difficult/unlikely to be triggered by a guest (or even host) user. In case it does happen, like in the upstream report, the stack overflow shall hit the stack canaries, resulting in DoS by crashing the kernel.",
  "acknowledgement": "",
  "name": "CVE-2020-10942",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel before 5.5.8, get_raw_socket in drivers/vhost/net.c lacks validation of an sk_family field, which might allow attackers to trigger kernel stack corruption via crafted system calls.",
    "A stack buffer overflow issue was found in the get_raw_socket() routine of the Host kernel accelerator for virtio net (vhost-net) driver. It could occur while doing an ictol(VHOST_NET_SET_BACKEND) call, and retrieving socket name in a kernel stack variable via get_raw_socket(). A user able to perform ioctl(2) calls on the '/dev/vhost-net' device may use this flaw to crash the kernel resulting in DoS issue."
