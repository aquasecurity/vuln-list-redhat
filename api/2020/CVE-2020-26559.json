  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning in the Bluetooth Mesh profile 1.0 and 1.0.1 may permit a nearby device (participating in the provisioning protocol) to identify the AuthValue used given the Provisioner’s public key, and the confirmation number and nonce provided by the provisioning device. This could permit a device without the AuthValue to complete provisioning without brute-forcing the AuthValue.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s Bluetooth Mesh Profile implementation. The Mesh Provisioning procedure has a vulnerability that allows an attacker that was provisioned without access to the AuthValue to identify the AuthValue directly, without brute-forcing its value. Even when a randomly generated AuthValue with a full 128-bits of entropy is used, an attacker acquiring the Provisioner’s public key, provisioning confirmation value, the random value, and providing its public key for use in the provisioning procedure can directly compute the AuthValue used. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
