    "An issue was discovered in spice-server spice-server-0.14.0-6.el7_6.1.x86_64 of Redhat's VDI product. There is a security vulnerablility that can restart KVMvirtual machine without any authorization. It is not yet known if there will be other other effects.",
    "A flaw was found in spice-server in Redhat's VDI product that can restart KVMvirtual machine without any authorization. A handshake is required before spice-server and spice-client can establish communication, and spice-client will send a request containing information that the server needs. This TCP request requires only host and port; A malformed TCP packet causes the vm to crash and the QEMu-KVM process to be restarted."
