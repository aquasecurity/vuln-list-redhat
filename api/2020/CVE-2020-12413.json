It reuses Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE) keys by default, but Attacking ECDH and ECDHE cipher suites are not in the scope of the Raccoon Attack and generally considered to be unaffected [1]. Further, reuse of ECDHE keys can be disabled starting in nss 3.17 [2].\nFor these reasons, Red Hat Product Security has marked the Severity of this flaw as Low.

  "details": [
    "The Raccoon attack is a timing attack on DHE ciphersuites inherit in the TLS specification. To mitigate this vulnerability, Firefox disabled support for DHE ciphersuites.",
    "A flaw was found in Mozilla nss. A raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman(DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
