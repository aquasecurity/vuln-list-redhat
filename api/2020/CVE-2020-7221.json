  "statement": "This flaw did not affect the versions of MariaDB as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, and 8 as they did not include the vulnerable code, which was introduced in a newer version of the package. The same is true for the versions of MariaDB as shipped with Red Hat Software Collections 3.",

  "name": "CVE-2020-7221",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "mysql_install_db in MariaDB 10.4.7 through 10.4.11 allows privilege escalation from the mysql user account to root because chown and chmod are performed unsafely, as demonstrated by a symlink attack on a chmod 04755 of auth_pam_tool_dir/auth_pam_tool. NOTE: this does not affect the Oracle MySQL product, which implements mysql_install_db differently.",
    "A privilege escalation vulnerability was found in MariaDB, in the way it handled a `setuid` program during the installation process. A local MySQL user could abuse this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system, by gaining root privileges once the bash script `mysql_install_db.sh` is executed."
