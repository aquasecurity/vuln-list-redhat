  "statement": "The ReDoS vulnerability in insane is categorized as an important severity issue rather than critical due to the specific conditions required for exploitation and the nature of the impact. ReDoS attacks exploit inefficient regular expressions that cause excessive backtracking, potentially slowing down or freezing an application under targeted input patterns. However, they do not typically allow code execution or unauthorized access to sensitive data, which would elevate it to a critical severity.\nLogging Subsystem for Red Hat OpenShiftdoes not impacted \u0026 unaffected by this specific CVE because it is used only in custom notification banners, which are not enabled for use in OpenShift Logging's Kibana.",
