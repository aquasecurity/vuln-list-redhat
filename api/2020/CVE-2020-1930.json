  "statement": "The attack is triggered by malicious specially crafted .cf files which are basically configuration files for spamassasin. These files can be located at:\n1. /usr/share/spamassassin\n2. /etc/mail/spamassassin\n3. user's home directory, in a directory called .spamassassin\nAll of these locations can only be accessed by either the system administrator or by a user having a local shell account on the machine. In order to successfully exploit this flaw, the attacker needs to convince the user to place the malicious configuration files in one of the above locations.",

  "name": "CVE-2020-1930",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A command execution issue was found in Apache SpamAssassin prior to 3.4.3. Carefully crafted nefarious rule configuration (.cf) files can be configured to run system commands similar to CVE-2018-11805. With this bug unpatched, exploits can be injected in a number of scenarios including the same privileges as spamd is run which may be elevated though doing so remotely is difficult. In addition to upgrading to SA 3.4.4, we again recommend that users should only use update channels or 3rd party .cf files from trusted places. If you cannot upgrade, do not use 3rd party rulesets, do not use sa-compile and do not run spamd as an account with elevated privileges."
