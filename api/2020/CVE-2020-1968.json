  "mitigation": "In OpenSSL 1.0.2e and below, this flaw can be mitigated by not enabling any ciphersuites with Diffie Hellman (DH), excluding ciphersuites using Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH).\nIn OpenSSL 1.0.2f and above, this flaw can be mitigated by not enabling static DH ciphersuites. Such ciphersuites start with `DH-` in OpenSSL and are mapped to IANA names that start with `TLS_DH_`, excluding ciphersuites that start with `TLS_DH_anon`. Following this convention, we see that `DH-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384` with IANA name `TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` is affected and should not be used in a mitigation of this flaw. However, `ECDH-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256`  with IANA name `TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` is not affected and may be used in a mitigation to this flaw, as it does not follow the `DH-` or `TLS_DH_` naming convention.",

  "details": [
    "The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection. The attack can only be exploited if an implementation re-uses a DH secret across multiple TLS connections. Note that this issue only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites. This issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.2 which is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not vulnerable to this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2w (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2v).",
    "A flaw was found in openssl in versions 1.0.2 to 1.0.2w.

In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
