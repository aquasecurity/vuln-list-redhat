  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Python-RSA before 4.1 ignores leading '\\0' bytes during decryption of ciphertext. This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact, e.g., by helping an attacker to infer that an application uses Python-RSA, or if the length of accepted ciphertext affects application behavior (such as by causing excessive memory allocation).",
    "A flaw was found in the python-rsa package, where it does not explicitly check the ciphertext length against the key size and ignores the leading 0 bytes during the decryption of the ciphertext. This flaw allows an attacker to perform a ciphertext attack, leading to a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality."
