  "details": [
    "url::recvline in url.cpp in libproxy 0.4.x through 0.4.15 allows a remote HTTP server to trigger uncontrolled recursion via a response composed of an infinite stream that lacks a newline character. This leads to stack exhaustion.",
    "A flaw was found in libproxy in versions 0.4 through 0.4.15. A remote HTTP server can trigger an uncontrolled recursion via a response composed of an infinite stream that lacks a newline character leading to a stack exhaustion. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
