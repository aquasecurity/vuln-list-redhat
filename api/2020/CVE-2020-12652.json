  "details": [
    "The __mptctl_ioctl function in drivers/message/fusion/mptctl.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.14 allows local users to hold an incorrect lock during the ioctl operation and trigger a race condition, i.e., a \"double fetch\" vulnerability, aka CID-28d76df18f0a. NOTE: the vendor states \"The security impact of this bug is not as bad as it could have been because these operations are all privileged and root already has enormous destructive power.\"",
    "A vulnerability was found in __mptctl_ioctl in drivers/message/fusion/mptctl.c in Fusion MPT base driver 'mptctl' in the SCSI device module, where an incorrect lock leads to a race problem. This flaw allows an attacker with local access and special user (or root) privileges to cause a denial of service."
