    "** DISPUTED ** gss_mech_free in net/sunrpc/auth_gss/gss_mech_switch.c in the rpcsec_gss_krb5 implementation in the Linux kernel through 5.6.10 lacks certain domain_release calls, leading to a memory leak. Note: This was disputed with the assertion that the issue does not grant any access not already available. It is a problem that on unloading a specific kernel module some memory is leaked, but loading kernel modules is a privileged operation. A user could also write a kernel module to consume any amount of memory they like and load that replicating the effect of this bug.",
    "A flaw was found in the implementation of the Linux kernel’s GSS mechanism registration functionality. During this period, memory allocation was not freed when the module was unloaded, leading to a memory leak. This flaw allows an attacker with the ability to repeat loads and unloads, to cause the system to run out of free memory and crash eventually."
