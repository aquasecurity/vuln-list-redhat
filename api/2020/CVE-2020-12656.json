    "gss_mech_free in net/sunrpc/auth_gss/gss_mech_switch.c in the rpcsec_gss_krb5 implementation in the Linux kernel through 5.6.10 lacks certain domain_release calls, leading to a memory leak. Note: This was disputed with the assertion that the issue does not grant any access not already available. It is a problem that on unloading a specific kernel module some memory is leaked, but loading kernel modules is a privileged operation. A user could also write a kernel module to consume any amount of memory they like and load that replicating the effect of this bug",
    "A flaw was found in the implementation of the Linux kernelâ€™s GSS mechanism registration functionality. During this period, memory allocation was not freed when the module was unloaded, leading to a memory leak. This flaw allows an attacker with the ability to repeat loads and unloads, to cause the system to run out of free memory and crash eventually."
