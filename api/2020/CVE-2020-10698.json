  "mitigation": "This issue is possible to mitigate by disabling the stdout from jobs run through the nginx configuration file. However this may affect the usage of Tower as stdout stream would be hidden. To disable the output of running jobs the entire 'location /websocket' block from the nginx configuration (and restarting nginx service) it would be required. Nginx will stop serving /websocket by 404 HTTP code return.",
