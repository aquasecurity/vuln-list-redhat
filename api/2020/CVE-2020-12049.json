    "An issue was discovered in dbus \u003e= 1.3.0 before 1.12.18. The DBusServer in libdbus, as used in dbus-daemon, leaks file descriptors when a message exceeds the per-message file descriptor limit. A local attacker with access to the D-Bus system bus or another system service's private AF_UNIX socket could use this to make the system service reach its file descriptor limit, denying service to subsequent D-Bus clients.",
    "An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability was discovered in D-Bus. The DBusServer leaks file descriptors when a message exceeds the per-message file descriptor limit. This flaw allows a local attacker with access to the D-Bus system bus or another system service's private AF_UNIX socket, to make the system service reach its file descriptor limit, denying service to subsequent D-Bus clients. As a result, the system may become unusable for other users, and some services may stop working. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
