  "statement": "The ReDoS vulnerability in the useragent library is considered an important severity rather than critical because it primarily affects application availability, not confidentiality or integrity. This vulnerability occurs when inefficient regular expressions lead to excessive backtracking under specific input patterns, potentially causing the application to slow down or become unresponsive. However, ReDoS attacks do not allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or access sensitive data directly.\nLogging Subsystem for Red Hat OpenShiftdoes not impacted \u0026 unaffected by this specific CVE because it is used only in the development environment.\nRed Hat Quay 3 does not impacted \u0026 unaffected by this specific CVE because its not using node to parse user requests.",
