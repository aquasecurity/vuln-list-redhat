  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0. Any user authenticated within a limited scope (trust/oauth/application credential) can create an EC2 credential with an escalated permission, such as obtaining admin while the user is on a limited viewer role. This potentially allows a malicious user to act as the admin on a project another user has the admin role on, which can effectively grant that user global admin privileges.",
    "A vulnerability was found in Keystone's EC2 credentials API. This flaw allows any user authenticated within a limited scope (trust/OAuth/application credential) to create an EC2 credential with escalated permissions, for example, obtaining an \"admin\" role, while the user is on a limited \"viewer\" role."
