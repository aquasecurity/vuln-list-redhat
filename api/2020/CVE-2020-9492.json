  "statement": "While OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) does package a vulnerable version of hadoop-hdfs-client in the hadoop and hive containers, the HDFS storage back-end is not enabled by default and is largely undocumented/unsupported. However, as it still can be enabled by using the configuration option `unsupportedFeatures.enabledHDFS`, the vulnerability has been rated Moderate for OCP.\nIn OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), the Hive/Presto/Hadoop components that comprise the OCP Metering stack, ship the vulnerable version of hadoop package.\nSince the release of OCP 4.6, the Metering product has been deprecated [1], hence the affected components are marked as wontfix.\nThis may be fixed in the future.\n[1] https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/release_notes/ocp-4-6-release-notes.html#ocp-4-6-metering-operator-deprecated",

  "details": [
    "In Apache Hadoop 3.2.0 to 3.2.1, 3.0.0-alpha1 to 3.1.3, and 2.0.0-alpha to 2.10.0, WebHDFS client might send SPNEGO authorization header to remote URL without proper verification.",
    "A flaw was found in Apache hadoop.  The WebHDFS client can send a SPNEGO authorization header to a remote URL without proper verification which could lead to an access restriction bypass. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
