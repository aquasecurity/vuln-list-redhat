  "statement": "This issue affects the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. This issue does not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 as they did not provide support for CLONE_IO. This issue does not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they already contain the fix. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0481.html.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The I/O implementation for block devices in the Linux kernel before 2.6.33 does not properly handle the CLONE_IO feature, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (I/O instability) by starting multiple processes that share an I/O context."
