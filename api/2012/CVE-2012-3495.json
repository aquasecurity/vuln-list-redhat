  "details": [
    "The physdev_get_free_pirq hypercall in arch/x86/physdev.c in Xen 4.1.x and Citrix XenServer 6.0.2 and earlier uses the return value of the get_free_pirq function as an array index without checking that the return value indicates an error, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (invalid memory write and host crash) and possibly gain privileges via unspecified vectors."
