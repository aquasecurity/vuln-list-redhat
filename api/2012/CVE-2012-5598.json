    "[REJECTED CVE] An integer overflow vulnerability has been identified in the dissect_iscsi_pdu() function in epan/dissectors/packet-iscsi.c in the iSCSI dissector in Wireshark. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted iSCSI packet / packet capture that, once processed, would lead to excessive CPU consumption or into situation where tshark executable would enter an infinite loop, when trying to process the crafted packet / packet capture file."
