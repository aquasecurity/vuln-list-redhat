  "statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they did not provide support for the KVM subsystem. This issue did not affect the versions of kvm as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as they did not include support for syscall instruction emulation. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0350.html.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The em_syscall function in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.14 does not properly handle the 0f05 (aka syscall) opcode, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) via a crafted application, as demonstrated by an NASM file."
