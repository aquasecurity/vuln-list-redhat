  "details": [
    "The serializing/deserializing functions in the qpid::framing::Buffer class in Apache Qpid 0.20 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this issue could also trigger an out-of-bounds read, but it might not trigger a crash."
