  "details": [
    "[REJECTED CVE] An out of heap-based buffer bounds read flaw was found in the way Wireshark, a network traffic analyzer, performed dissection of certain ISAKMP packets. The issue occurs because dissect_isakmp() function in epan/dissectors/packet-isakmp.c in the ISAKMP dissector uses an incorrect data structure to determine IKEv2 decryption parameters. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted ISAKMP packet / packet capture that, when processed, would lead to wireshark executable crash."
