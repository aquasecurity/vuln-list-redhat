  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The sock_setsockopt function in net/core/sock.c in the Linux kernel before 3.5.7 does not ensure that a keepalive action is associated with a stream socket, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) by leveraging the ability to create a raw socket.",
    "It was found that the Linux kernel's networking implementation did not correctly handle the setting of the keepalive socket option on raw sockets. A local user able to create a raw socket could use this flaw to crash the system."
