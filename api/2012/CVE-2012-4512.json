  "details": [
    "The CSS parser (khtml/css/cssparser.cpp) in Konqueror in KDE 4.7.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly read memory via a crafted font face source, related to \"type confusion.\"",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the CSS parser of the Document Object Model's (DOM) implementation of KDE libraries performed processing of a location of a particular font face source. A remote attacker with privileges could provide a specially-crafted web page that, when opened in an application linked against KDE libraries, would lead to the application crashing or potential execution of arbitrary code."
