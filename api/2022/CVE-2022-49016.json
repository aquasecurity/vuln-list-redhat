    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnet: mdiobus: fix unbalanced node reference count\nI got the following report while doing device(mscc-miim) load test\nwith CONFIG_OF_UNITTEST and CONFIG_OF_DYNAMIC enabled:\nOF: ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount 1 instead of 2,\nof_node_get()/of_node_put() unbalanced - destroy cset entry:\nattach overlay node /spi/soc@0/mdio@7107009c/ethernet-phy@0\nIf the 'fwnode' is not an acpi node, the refcount is get in\nfwnode_mdiobus_phy_device_register(), but it has never been\nput when the device is freed in the normal path. So call\nfwnode_handle_put() in phy_device_release() to avoid leak.\nIf it's an acpi node, it has never been get, but it's put\nin the error path, so call fwnode_handle_get() before\nphy_device_register() to keep get/put operation balanced.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's mdiobus subsystem, causing unbalanced reference counts for firmware nodes (fwnode), leading to memory leaks and potential instability. The issue occurred because fwnode_mdiobus_phy_device_register() incremented the reference count for non-ACPI nodes without a corresponding decrement during device release, while the ACPI nodes lacked proper reference balancing in error paths."
