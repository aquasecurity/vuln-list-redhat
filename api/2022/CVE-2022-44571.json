  "details": [
    "There is a denial of service vulnerability in the Content-Disposition parsingcomponent of Rack fixed in 2.0.9.2, 2.1.4.2, 2.2.4.1, 3.0.0.1. This could allow an attacker to craft an input that can cause Content-Disposition header parsing in Rackto take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial ofservice attack vector. This header is used typically used in multipartparsing. Any applications that parse multipart posts using Rack (virtuallyall Rails applications) are impacted.",
    "A flaw was found in rubygem-rack. Rack is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) flaw in the multipart parser. By sending a specially-crafted regex input, a remote attacker can cause a denial of service."
