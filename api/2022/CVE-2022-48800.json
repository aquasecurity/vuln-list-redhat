    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nmm: vmscan: remove deadlock due to throttling failing to make progress\nA soft lockup bug in kcompactd was reported in a private bugzilla with\nthe following visible in dmesg;\nwatchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#33 stuck for 26s! [kcompactd0:479]\nwatchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#33 stuck for 52s! [kcompactd0:479]\nwatchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#33 stuck for 78s! [kcompactd0:479]\nwatchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#33 stuck for 104s! [kcompactd0:479]\nThe machine had 256G of RAM with no swap and an earlier failed\nallocation indicated that node 0 where kcompactd was run was potentially\nunreclaimable;\nNode 0 active_anon:29355112kB inactive_anon:2913528kB active_file:0kB\ninactive_file:0kB unevictable:64kB isolated(anon):0kB isolated(file):0kB\nmapped:8kB dirty:0kB writeback:0kB shmem:26780kB shmem_thp:\n0kB shmem_pmdmapped: 0kB anon_thp: 23480320kB writeback_tmp:0kB\nkernel_stack:2272kB pagetables:24500kB all_unreclaimable? yes\nVlastimil Babka investigated a crash dump and found that a task\nmigrating pages was trying to drain PCP lists;\nPID: 52922  TASK: ffff969f820e5000  CPU: 19  COMMAND: \"kworker/u128:3\"\nCall Trace:\n__schedule\nschedule\nschedule_timeout\nwait_for_completion\n__flush_work\n__drain_all_pages\n__alloc_pages_slowpath.constprop.114\n__alloc_pages\nalloc_migration_target\nmigrate_pages\nmigrate_to_node\ndo_migrate_pages\ncpuset_migrate_mm_workfn\nprocess_one_work\nworker_thread\nkthread\nret_from_fork\nThis failure is specific to CONFIG_PREEMPT=n builds.  The root of the\nproblem is that kcompact0 is not rescheduling on a CPU while a task that\nhas isolated a large number of the pages from the LRU is waiting on\nkcompact0 to reschedule so the pages can be released.  While\nshrink_inactive_list() only loops once around too_many_isolated, reclaim\ncan continue without rescheduling if sc-\u003eskipped_deactivate == 1 which\ncould happen if there was no file LRU and the inactive anon list was not\nlow."
