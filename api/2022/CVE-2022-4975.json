  "statement": "To exploit this flaw, an attacker needs to be able to create a RHACS policy or an OpenShift cluster role with a specially crafted name. Additionally, the OpenShift cluster must be monitored by RHACS.\nTo perform these actions, an attacker needs to be authenticated, limiting the possibility of this issue to be exploited.\nFor this reason, this flaw has been rated with a Low severity.",

  "name": "CVE-2022-4975",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) portal. When rendering a table view in the portal, for example, on any of the /main/configmanagement/* endpoints, the front-end generates a DOM table-element (id=\"pdf-table\"). This information is then populated with unsanitized data using innerHTML. An attacker with some control over the data rendered can trigger a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability."
