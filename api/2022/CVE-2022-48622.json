  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in GNOME's GdkPixbuf library, a library used to load image data in various formats used by GDK for handling graphical assets. This issue occurs when loading a crafted ANI (animated cursor file) file, which may lead to a heap based out-of-bounds write, causing memory corruption. When a successful attack is in place, it can lead to a denial of service or in some cases arbitrary code execution."
