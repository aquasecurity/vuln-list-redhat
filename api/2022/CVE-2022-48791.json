    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nscsi: pm8001: Fix use-after-free for aborted TMF sas_task\nCurrently a use-after-free may occur if a TMF sas_task is aborted before we\nhandle the IO completion in mpi_ssp_completion(). The abort occurs due to\ntimeout.\nWhen the timeout occurs, the SAS_TASK_STATE_ABORTED flag is set and the\nsas_task is freed in pm8001_exec_internal_tmf_task().\nHowever, if the I/O completion occurs later, the I/O completion still\nthinks that the sas_task is available. Fix this by clearing the ccb-\u003etask\nif the TMF times out - the I/O completion handler does nothing if this\npointer is cleared.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the SCSI driver involved a use-after-free issue when a TMF sas_task was aborted due to a timeout. If I/O completion occurred after the abort, the handler accessed the already freed sas_task, leading to a potential crash."
