  "details": [
    "Subversion's mod_dav_svn is vulnerable to memory corruption. While looking up path-based authorization rules, mod_dav_svn servers may attempt to use memory which has already been freed. Affected Subversion mod_dav_svn servers 1.10.0 through 1.14.1 (inclusive). Servers that do not use mod_dav_svn are not affected.",
    "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in Subversion in the mod_dav_svn Apache HTTP server (HTTPd) module. While looking up path-based authorization (authz) rules, multiple calls to the post_config hook can invalidate cached pointers to object-pools, which Subversion subsequently uses. This issue crashes the single HTTPd worker thread or the entire HTTPd server process, depending on the configuration of the Apache HTTPd server."
