  "details": [
    "[REJECTED CVE] A vulnerability has been identified in the axios library where cookies can be leaked to unauthorized domains during HTTP redirects. This occurs because axios includes the original Cookie header when following a Location redirect to a different domain, violating the same-origin policy. An attacker could exploit this by redirecting requests to their controlled domain, gaining access to sensitive cookies and potentially hijacking user accounts."
