    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nwatch_queue: Fix filter limit check\nIn watch_queue_set_filter(), there are a couple of places where we check\nthat the filter type value does not exceed what the type_filter bitmap\ncan hold.  One place calculates the number of bits by:\nif (tf[i].type \u003e= sizeof(wfilter-\u003etype_filter) * 8)\nwhich is fine, but the second does:\nif (tf[i].type \u003e= sizeof(wfilter-\u003etype_filter) * BITS_PER_LONG)\nwhich is not.  This can lead to a couple of out-of-bounds writes due to\na too-large type:\n(1) __set_bit() on wfilter-\u003etype_filter\n(2) Writing more elements in wfilter-\u003efilters[] than we allocated.\nFix this by just using the proper WATCH_TYPE__NR instead, which is the\nnumber of types we actually know about.\nThe bug may cause an oops looking something like:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in watch_queue_set_filter+0x659/0x740\nWrite of size 4 at addr ffff88800d2c66bc by task watch_queue_oob/611\n...\nCall Trace:\n\u003cTASK\u003e\ndump_stack_lvl+0x45/0x59\nprint_address_description.constprop.0+0x1f/0x150\n...\nkasan_report.cold+0x7f/0x11b\n...\nwatch_queue_set_filter+0x659/0x740\n...\n__x64_sys_ioctl+0x127/0x190\ndo_syscall_64+0x43/0x90\nentry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\nAllocated by task 611:\nkasan_save_stack+0x1e/0x40\n__kasan_kmalloc+0x81/0xa0\nwatch_queue_set_filter+0x23a/0x740\n__x64_sys_ioctl+0x127/0x190\ndo_syscall_64+0x43/0x90\nentry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\nThe buggy address belongs to the object at ffff88800d2c66a0\nwhich belongs to the cache kmalloc-32 of size 32\nThe buggy address is located 28 bytes inside of\n32-byte region [ffff88800d2c66a0, ffff88800d2c66c0)",
