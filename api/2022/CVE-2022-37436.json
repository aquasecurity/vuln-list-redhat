  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Prior to Apache HTTP Server 2.4.55, a malicious backend can cause the response headers to be truncated early, resulting in some headers being incorporated into the response body. If the later headers have any security purpose, they will not be interpreted by the client.",
    "A flaw was found in the mod_proxy module of httpd. A malicious backend can cause the response headers to be truncated because they are not cleaned when an error is found while reading them, resulting in some headers being incorporated into the response body and not being interpreted by a client."
