    "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.10. In drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_ca_en50221.c, a use-after-free can occur is there is a disconnect after an open, because of the lack of a wait_event.",
    "A race condition flaw leading to a use-after-free issue was found in the Linux kernel media subsystem in the DVB CA EN50221 interface of the DVB core device driver. It could occur in the dvb_ca_en50221_release() function if there is a disconnect after an open, because of the lack of a wait_event. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system."
