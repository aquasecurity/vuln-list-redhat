Call pci_dev_put() in\nthe error path to fix this.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the amd_pmc_probe() function in the Linux kernel's AMD PMC driver, where a reference count leak can occur because the function does not properly release the reference count obtained by pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot(). Over time, this could lead to memory exhaustion."
