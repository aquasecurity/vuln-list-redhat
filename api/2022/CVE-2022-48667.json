    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nsmb3: fix temporary data corruption in insert range\ninsert range doesn't discard the affected cached region\nso can risk temporarily corrupting file data.\nAlso includes some minor cleanup (avoiding rereading\ninode size repeatedly unnecessarily) to make it clearer.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's Server Message Block version 3 (SMB3 ) protocol, specifically related to the insert range operation. This issue occurs when cached regions affected by the insert range operation are not properly discarded, which could lead to temporary file data corruption."
