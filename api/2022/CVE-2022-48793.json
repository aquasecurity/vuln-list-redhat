  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nKVM: x86: nSVM: fix potential NULL derefernce on nested migration\nTurns out that due to review feedback and/or rebases\nI accidentally moved the call to nested_svm_load_cr3 to be too early,\nbefore the NPT is enabled, which is very wrong to do.\nKVM can't even access guest memory at that point as nested NPT\nis needed for that, and of course it won't initialize the walk_mmu,\nwhich is main issue the patch was addressing.\nFix this for real.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the nested.c file in the Linux kernel's KVM driver, where a potential NULL dereference can occur. This happens when the call to load the nested state is executed before Nested Page Tables (NPT) are enabled, preventing access to guest memory, lead to system instability and a denial of service during nested migration processes."
