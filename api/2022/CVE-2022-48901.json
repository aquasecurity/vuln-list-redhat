    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nbtrfs: do not start relocation until in progress drops are done\nWe hit a bug with a recovering relocation on mount for one of our file\nsystems in production.

However if we had a\npending balance waiting to get the -\u003ecleaner_mutex, and a snapshot\ndeletion was running, and then the box crashed, we would come up in a\nstate where we have a half deleted snapshot.\nAgain, in the normal case the snapshot deletion needs to complete before\nrelocation can start, but in this case relocation could very well start\nbefore the snapshot deletion completes, as we simply add the root to the\ndead roots list and wait for the next time the cleaner runs to clean up\nthe snapshot.\nFix this by setting a bit on the fs_info if we have any DEAD_ROOT's that\nhad a pending drop_progress key.  If they do then we know we were in the\nmiddle of the drop operation and set a flag on the fs_info.  Then\nbalance can wait until this flag is cleared to start up again.\nIf there are DEAD_ROOT's that don't have a drop_progress set then we're\nsafe to start balance right away as we'll be properly protected by the\ncleaner_mutex.",
