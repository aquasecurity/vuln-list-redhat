  "details": [
    "The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc module of the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2.34 copies its path argument on the stack without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow, potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.",
    "A stack based buffer-overflow vulnerability was found in the deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create() in the sunrpc's svc_unix.c module of the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2.34. This vulnerability copies its path argument onto the stack without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow, potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is not built with a stack protector enabled) then it will lead to arbitrary code execution."
