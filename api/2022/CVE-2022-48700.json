  "details": [
    "[REJECTED CVE] A vulnerability was identified in the Linux kernelâ€™s vfio/type1 subsystem, where a reference count leak on the zero page occurred due to improper handling in put_pfn(). The page was pinned via pin_user_pages_remote() but not properly unpinned, leading to a resource exhaustion risk. An attacker could exploit this by repeatedly mapping zero pages, potentially causing a reference count overflow, leading to undefined behavior or system instability."
