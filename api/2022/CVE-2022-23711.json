    "A vulnerability in Kibana could expose sensitive information related to Elastic Stack monitoring in the Kibana page source. Elastic Stack monitoring features provide a way to keep a pulse on the health and performance of your Elasticsearch cluster. Authentication with a vulnerable Kibana instance is not required to view the exposed information. The Elastic Stack monitoring exposure only impacts users that have set any of the optional monitoring.ui.elasticsearch.* settings in order to configure Kibana as a remote UI for Elastic Stack Monitoring. The same vulnerability in Kibana could expose other non-sensitive application-internal information in the page source.",
    "A flaw was found in Kibana that could result in an attacker exposing sensitive information related to Elastic Stack monitoring in the Kibana page source, if a user has set the optional monitoring.ui.elasticsearch.* settings. This could result in a loss of confidentiality and integrity."
