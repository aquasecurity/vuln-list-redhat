  "statement": "Red Hat believes this vulnerability to be of moderate impact because one of the requisites for exploitation is the ability to run unprivileged code on the victim's machine; furthermore, the complexity of this attack is high, as it requires the ability to analyze cache access patterns and combine this with a sufficient number of handshake instances and an offline dictionary attack.\nIt is important to note that this CVE was filed as the preceding CVE-2019-9495, which was intended to address several potential side channel attacks present in `wpa_supplicant`, was found to be a partial fix and did not address the cache-based attack mentioned in this CVE.\nIn RHEL-8, the vulnerable configurations of `wpa_supplicant` and `hostapd` with `SAE` and `EAP-pwd` support (`CONFIG_SAE=y` and `CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y`, respectively) are not compiled.\nIn RHEL-9, no vulnerable versions of `wpa_supplicant` are built (versions prior to 2.10), meaning that it is not susceptible to this vulnerability.",

  "details": [
    "The implementations of EAP-pwd in hostapd before 2.10 and wpa_supplicant before 2.10 are vulnerable to side-channel attacks as a result of cache access patterns. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-9495.",
    "The implementations of EAP-pwd in hostapd before 2.10 and wpa_supplicant before 2.10 are vulnerable to side-channel attacks as a result of cache access patterns. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to availability, confidentiality and integrity."
