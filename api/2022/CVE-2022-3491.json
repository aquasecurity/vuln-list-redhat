    "Heap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0742.",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in Vim's skipwhite() function of the charset.c file. This issue occurs when reading data past the end of the line when compiling a function with errors. This could allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering an out-of-bounds read that causes an application to crash, leading to a denial of service."
