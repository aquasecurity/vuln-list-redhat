    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nRDMA/hfi1: Prevent use of lock before it is initialized\nIf there is a failure during probe of hfi1 before the sdma_map_lock is\ninitialized, the call to hfi1_free_devdata() will attempt to use a lock\nthat has not been initialized. If the locking correctness validator is on\nthen an INFO message and stack trace resembling the following may be seen:\nINFO: trying to register non-static key.\nThe code is fine but needs lockdep annotation, or maybe\nyou didn't initialize this object before use?\nturning off the locking correctness validator.\nCall Trace:\nregister_lock_class+0x11b/0x880\n__lock_acquire+0xf3/0x7930\nlock_acquire+0xff/0x2d0\n_raw_spin_lock_irq+0x46/0x60\nsdma_clean+0x42a/0x660 [hfi1]\nhfi1_free_devdata+0x3a7/0x420 [hfi1]\ninit_one+0x867/0x11a0 [hfi1]\npci_device_probe+0x40e/0x8d0\nThe use of sdma_map_lock in sdma_clean() is for freeing the sdma_map\nmemory, and sdma_map is not allocated/initialized until after\nsdma_map_lock has been initialized. This code only needs to be run if\nsdma_map is not NULL, and so checking for that condition will avoid trying\nto use the lock before it is initialized."
