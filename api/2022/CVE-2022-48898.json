    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ndrm/msm/dp: do not complete dp_aux_cmd_fifo_tx() if irq is not for aux transfer\nThere are 3 possible interrupt sources are handled by DP controller,\nHPDstatus, Controller state changes and Aux read/write transaction.\nAt every irq, DP controller have to check isr status of every interrupt\nsources and service the interrupt if its isr status bits shows interrupts\nare pending. There is potential race condition may happen at current aux\nisr handler implementation since it is always complete dp_aux_cmd_fifo_tx()\neven irq is not for aux read or write transaction. This may cause aux read\ntransaction return premature if host aux data read is in the middle of\nwaiting for sink to complete transferring data to host while irq happen.\nThis will cause host's receiving buffer contains unexpected data. This\npatch fixes this problem by checking aux isr and return immediately at\naux isr handler if there are no any isr status bits set.\nCurrent there is a bug report regrading eDP edid corruption happen during\nsystem booting up. After lengthy debugging to found that VIDEO_READY\ninterrupt was continuously firing during system booting up which cause\ndp_aux_isr() to complete dp_aux_cmd_fifo_tx() prematurely to retrieve data\nfrom aux hardware buffer which is not yet contains complete data transfer\nfrom sink. This cause edid corruption.\nFollows are the signature at kernel logs when problem happen,\nEDID has corrupt header\npanel-simple-dp-aux aux-aea0000.edp: Couldn't identify panel via EDID\nChanges in v2:\n-- do complete if (ret == IRQ_HANDLED) ay dp-aux_isr()\n-- add more commit text\nChanges in v3:\n-- add Stephen suggested\n-- dp_aux_isr() return IRQ_XXX back to caller\n-- dp_ctrl_isr() return IRQ_XXX back to caller\nChanges in v4:\n-- split into two patches\nChanges in v5:\n-- delete empty line between tags\nChanges in v6:\n-- remove extra \"that\" and fixed line more than 75 char at commit text\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/516121/"
