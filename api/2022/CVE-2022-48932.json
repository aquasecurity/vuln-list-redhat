  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnet/mlx5: DR, Fix slab-out-of-bounds in mlx5_cmd_dr_create_fte\nWhen adding a rule with 32 destinations, we hit the following out-of-band\naccess issue:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in mlx5_cmd_dr_create_fte+0x18ee/0x1e70\nThis patch fixes the issue by both increasing the allocated buffers to\naccommodate for the needed actions and by checking the number of actions\nto prevent this issue when a rule with too many actions is provided.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's Ethernet fs_dr.c driver in the mlx5_cmd_dr_create_fte() function, where a slab-out-of-bounds can occur. This flaw is caused by how the driver allocates and manages memory when dealing with flow rules actions. A rule can have up to 32 destinations, but additional actions can also be stored in the same buffer used for destinations. The out-of-bounds access occurs when the allocated buffer size is insufficiently sized to contain all possible actions (more than 32), potentially leading to memory corruption or system instability."
