  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nmisc: fastrpc: Fix use-after-free and race in fastrpc_map_find\nCurrently, there is a race window between the point when the mutex is\nunlocked in fastrpc_map_lookup and the reference count increasing\n(fastrpc_map_get) in fastrpc_map_find, which can also lead to\nuse-after-free.\nSo lets merge fastrpc_map_find into fastrpc_map_lookup which allows us\nto both protect the maps list by also taking the \u0026fl-\u003elock spinlock and\nthe reference count, since the spinlock will be released only after.\nAdd take_ref argument to make this suitable for all callers.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's fastrpc.c driver. A race condition is possible between the time that the fastrpc_map_lookup() function unlocks a mutex and the reference count is increased by the fastrpc_map_get() function in the fastrpc_map_find() function. This race condition could result in a use-after-free situation, where a mapping object is freed while still being referenced by something else. This issue could lead to memory corruption or unpredictable behavior."
