  "details": [
    "vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with whitelisted Node's built-in modules. In versions prior to version 3.9.11, a threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version 3.9.11 of vm2. There are no known workarounds.",
    "A flaw was found in the vm2 sandbox when running untrusted code, as the sandbox setup does not manage proper exception handling. This flaw allows an attacker to bypass the sandbox protections and gain remote code execution on the hypervisor host or the host which is running the sandbox."
