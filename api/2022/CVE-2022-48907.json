    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nauxdisplay: lcd2s: Fix memory leak in -\u003eremove()\nOnce allocated the struct lcd2s_data is never freed.\nFix the memory leak by switching to devm_kzalloc().",
    "A memory leak vulnerability was found in the lcd2s driver in the Linux kernel's auxdisplay subsystem. The struct lcd2s_data is allocated but not freed when the device is removed, leading to a potential memory leak over time. An attacker could leverage this issue in a resource exhaustion attack, where repeated loading and unloading of the lcd2s driver leads to increased memory usage, potentially impacting system performance."
