    "An issue was discovered in ksmbd in the Linux kernel 5.15 through 5.19 before 5.19.2. fs/ksmbd/smb2misc.c has an out-of-bounds read and OOPS for SMB2_TREE_CONNECT.",
    "A denial-of-service flaw was found in the Linux Kernel while handling SMB2_TREE_CONNECT commands in CIFS Filesystem. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition in the system."
