I would like to request a re-evaluation of this issue as not being a compliance priority.",

  "name": "CVE-2022-3606",

  "details": [
    "A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. This affects the function find_prog_by_sec_insn of the file tools/lib/bpf/libbpf.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to null pointer dereference. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211749 was assigned to this vulnerability.",
    "A flaw was found in libbpf. When there are no program sections, obj-\u003eprograms is left unallocated, causing a NULL pointer dereference in the following access to prog-\u003esec_idx in find_prog_by_sec_insn. A local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service."
