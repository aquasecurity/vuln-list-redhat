    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ncfg80211: fix race in netlink owner interface destruction\nMy previous fix here to fix the deadlock left a race where\nthe exact same deadlock (see the original commit referenced\nbelow) can still happen if cfg80211_destroy_ifaces() already\nruns while nl80211_netlink_notify() is still marking some\ninterfaces as nl_owner_dead.\nThe race happens because we have two loops here - first we\ndev_close() all the netdevs, and then we destroy them. If we\nalso have two netdevs (first one need only be a wdev though)\nthen we can find one during the first iteration, close it,\nand go to the second iteration -- but then find two, and try\nto destroy also the one we didn't close yet.\nFix this by only iterating once.",
    "A race condition vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel. If cfg80211_destroy_ifaces() is running while nl80211_netlink_notify() is still marking interfaces as nl_owner_dead, a race condition can occur, resulting in denial of service, leading to loss of availability of the system."
