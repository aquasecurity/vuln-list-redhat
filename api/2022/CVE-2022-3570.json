    "Multiple heap buffer overflows in tiffcrop.c utility in libtiff library Version 4.4.0 allows attacker to trigger unsafe or out of bounds memory access via crafted TIFF image file which could result into application crash, potential information disclosure or any other context-dependent impact",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in Libtiff's tiffcrop utility. This issue occurs during the conversion of a TIFF image file, allowing an attacker to pass a crafted TIFF image file to tiffcrop utility, which causes an out-of-bound access resulting an application crash, eventually leading to a denial of service."
