    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Hyper-V VMBus driver, which involved a memory leak caused by improper handling of the kobject_init_and_add() function in vmbus_add_channel_kobj(). When this function fails, it still references the kobject, which must be released by calling kobject_put()."
