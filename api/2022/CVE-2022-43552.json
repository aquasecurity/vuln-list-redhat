  "statement": "Potential successful exploitation will cause the curl to crash, which generates a low impact to the environment where the curl is used. Additionally, exploitation depends on the conditions that are out of the attacker's control, like usage of specific protocols (SMB or TELNET) and HTTP proxy tunnels at the same time. Due to these facts, this vulnerability has been classified as a Low severity issue.",

  "details": [
    "A use after free vulnerability exists in curl \u003c7.87.0. Curl can be asked to *tunnel* virtually all protocols it supports through an HTTP proxy. HTTP proxies can (and often do) deny such tunnel operations. When getting denied to tunnel the specific protocols SMB or TELNET, curl would use a heap-allocated struct after it had been freed, in its transfer shutdown code path.",

HTTP proxies can deny these tunnel operations using an appropriate HTTP error response code. When getting denied to tunnel the specific SMB or TELNET protocols, curl can use a heap-allocated struct after it has been freed and shut down the code path in its transfer."
