  "statement": "Actual only for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.\nFixed for all versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.\nReading the source code, related source in function __rtnl_newlink or in rtnl_newlink for newer versions.\nThe fix is that setting to NULL these vars\n+master_dev = NULL;\n+m_ops = NULL;\njust before usage (before call \"master_dev = netdev_master_upper_dev_get(dev);\"),\nbut not in advance in the beginning of func __rtnl_newlink.\nIt means that for some complex conditions potentially these vars could be inited with some incorrect values between. No known ways to reproduce it, so saying generally could be considered as not a security issue (or maybe as potential security issue with low level impact).\nThe bug could happen only if function rtnl_link_ops_get(..) returns some \"ops\" (instead of NULL).\nThis could happen if some option \"kind\" exists. Basically it could happen only if IFLA_INFO_KIND being used (that is ops-\u003ekind).\nIt is possible to set this \"ops-\u003ekind\" during __rtnl_newlink(..) call.\nSee \"RTM_NEWLINK\" in doc https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/rtnetlink.7.html\nI think that regular user cannot trigger call to the \"RTM_NEWLINK\", so only privileged user can try to trigger this issue (potentially, because unlikely that can find way how to trigger it).",
