    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\niio: adc: tsc2046: fix memory corruption by preventing array overflow\nOn one side we have indio_dev-\u003enum_channels includes all physical channels +\ntimestamp channel. On other side we have an array allocated only for\nphysical channels. So, fix memory corruption by ARRAY_SIZE() instead of\nnum_channels variable.\nNote the first case is a cleanup rather than a fix as the software\ntimestamp channel bit in active_scanmask is never set by the IIO core."
