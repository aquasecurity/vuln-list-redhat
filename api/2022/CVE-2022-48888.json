    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ndrm/msm/dpu: Fix memory leak in msm_mdss_parse_data_bus_icc_path\nof_icc_get() alloc resources for path1, we should release it when not\nneed anymore. Early return when IS_ERR_OR_NULL(path0) may leak path1.\nDefer getting path1 to fix this.\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/514264/",
    "A vulnerability was found in the function msm_mdss_parse_data_bus_icc_path() in the Linux kernel's msm_mdss.c driver. This issue occurs when the of_icc_get() function is called to allocate resources for path1, but msm_mdss_parse_data_bus_icc_path() never releases that memory when it is no longer needed. This can lead to resource exhaustion if the function is called repeatedly over time."
