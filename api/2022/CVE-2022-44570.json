  "details": [
    "A denial of service vulnerability in the Range header parsing component of Rack \u003e= 1.5.0. A Carefully crafted input can cause the Range header parsing component in Rack to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial of service attack vector. Any applications that deal with Range requests (such as streaming applications, or applications that serve files) may be impacted.",
    "A flaw was found in rubygem-rack. Rack is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) flaw in the Rack::Utils.get_byte_ranges function. By sending a specially-crafted regex input, a remote attacker can cause a denial of service."
