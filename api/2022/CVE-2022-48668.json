    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nsmb3: fix temporary data corruption in collapse range\ncollapse range doesn't discard the affected cached region\nso can risk temporarily corrupting the file data. This\nfixes xfstest generic/031\nI also decided to merge a minor cleanup to this into the same patch\n(avoiding rereading inode size repeatedly unnecessarily) to make it\nclearer.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Server Message Block version 3 (SMB3) file-sharing protocol. This flaw occurs during the collapse range operation, where the cached region is not properly discarded. This improper handling can lead to temporary data corruption in files, particularly when multiple file operations occur simultaneously.\nThe issue was identified and resolved by ensuring that the collapse range operation correctly handles cached regions to prevent this data corruption. The vulnerability was fixed in kernel versions such as 5.19.12 and later, along with a minor cleanup that streamlined the handling of inode sizes to make the code more efficient."
