  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnet: dsa: fix panic on shutdown if multi-chip tree failed to probe\nDSA probing is atypical because a tree of devices must probe all at\nonce, so out of N switches which call dsa_tree_setup_routing_table()\nduring probe, for (N - 1) of them, \"complete\" will return false and they\nwill exit probing early. The Nth switch will set up the whole tree on\ntheir behalf.\nThe implication is that for (N - 1) switches, the driver binds to the\ndevice successfully, without doing anything. When the driver is bound,\nthe -\u003eshutdown() method may run. But if the Nth switch has failed to\ninitialize the tree, there is nothing to do for the (N - 1) driver\ninstances, since the slave devices have not been created, etc. Moreover,\ndsa_switch_shutdown() expects that the calling @ds has been in fact\ninitialized, so it jumps at dereferencing the various data structures,\nwhich is incorrect.\nAvoid the ensuing NULL pointer dereferences by simply checking whether\nthe Nth switch has previously set \"ds-\u003esetup = true\" for the switch\nwhich is currently shutting down. The entire setup is serialized under\ndsa2_mutex which we already hold."
