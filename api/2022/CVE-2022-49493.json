  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nASoC: rt5645: Fix errorenous cleanup order\nThere is a logic error when removing rt5645 device as the function\nrt5645_i2c_remove() first cancel the \u0026rt5645-\u003ejack_detect_work and\ndelete the \u0026rt5645-\u003ebtn_check_timer latter. However, since the timer\nhandler rt5645_btn_check_callback() will re-queue the jack_detect_work,\nthis cleanup order is buggy.\nThat is, once the del_timer_sync in rt5645_i2c_remove is concurrently\nrun with the rt5645_btn_check_callback, the canceled jack_detect_work\nwill be rescheduled again, leading to possible use-after-free.\nThis patch fix the issue by placing the del_timer_sync function before\nthe cancel_delayed_work_sync."
