  "details": [
    "The generic_file_splice_write function in fs/splice.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.19 does not properly strip setuid and setgid bits when there is a write to a file, which allows local users to gain the privileges of a different group, and obtain sensitive information or possibly have unspecified other impact, by splicing into an inode in order to create an executable file in a setgid directory, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-4210."
