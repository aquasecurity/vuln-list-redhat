  "statement": "Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of the Vim packages, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4, and 5.\nNote: This CVE is mentioned in the text of RHSA-2008:0580 as it was originally used to track multiple issues. Issues that affected Vim packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 were later assigned separate CVE identifier - CVE-2008-6235. Neither of issues currently covered by CVE-2008-3076 (insufficient shell escaping in mz and mc commands) affected Vim packages shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.",

  "name": "CVE-2008-3076",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The Netrw plugin 125 in netrw.vim in Vim 7.2a.10 allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via shell metacharacters in filenames used by the execute and system functions within the (1) mz and (2) mc commands, as demonstrated by the netrw.v2 and netrw.v3 test cases.  NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2712."
