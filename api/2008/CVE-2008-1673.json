  "statement": "Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2, 3, 4, 5 or Red Hat Enterprise MRG.\nThe but existed on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5. However, this is only a security issue if the SLOB or SLUB memory allocators were used (introduced in Linux kernel versions 2.6.16 and 2.6.22, respectively). All Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Enterprise MRG kernels use the SLAB memory allocator, which in this case, cannot be exploited to allow arbitrary code execution. As a preventive measure, the underlying bug was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5, via the advisories RHSA-2008:0973, RHSA-2008:0508, and RHSA-2008:0519, respectively.",

  "details": [
    "The asn1 implementation in (a) the Linux kernel 2.4 before 2.4.36.6 and 2.6 before 2.6.25.5, as used in the cifs and ip_nat_snmp_basic modules; and (b) the gxsnmp package; does not properly validate length values during decoding of ASN.1 BER data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via (1) a length greater than the working buffer, which can lead to an unspecified overflow; (2) an oid length of zero, which can lead to an off-by-one error; or (3) an indefinite length for a primitive encoding."
