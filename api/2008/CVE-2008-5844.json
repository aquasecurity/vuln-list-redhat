  "statement": "Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of the php package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4, 5, and with Red Hat Application Stack v1 and v2. Only PHP version 5.2.7 was affected by this flaw.",

  "name": "CVE-2008-5844",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "PHP 5.2.7 contains an incorrect change to the FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW functionality, and unintentionally disables magic_quotes_gpc regardless of the actual magic_quotes_gpc setting, which might make it easier for context-dependent attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks and unspecified other attacks."
