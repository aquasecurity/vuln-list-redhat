The impact of this flaw is limited to a crash of the applications connecting to a misbehaving SMTP server. Due to those reasons, theres currently no plan to include the fix in the imap packages as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3, and the libc-client packages as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.",
