    "Off-by-one error in the inet_network function in libbind in ISC BIND 9.4.2 and earlier, as used in libc in FreeBSD 6.2 through 7.0-PRERELEASE, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted input that triggers memory corruption."
