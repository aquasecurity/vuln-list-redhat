  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "GnuTLS before 2.9.10 does not verify the activation and expiration dates of CA certificates, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers via a certificate issued by a CA certificate that is (1) not yet valid or (2) no longer valid.",
    "It was found that GnuTLS did not check activation and expiration dates of CA certificates. This could cause an application using GnuTLS to incorrectly accept a certificate as valid when its issuing CA is already expired."
