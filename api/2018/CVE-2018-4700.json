    "[REJECTED CVE] A predictable session cookie vulnerability was identified in the CUPS printing server. Insufficient randomness in session cookie generation made it easy to guess, undermining CSRF protection. This flaw allowed unauthorized scripted access to the CUPS web interface when enabled, posing a risk of unauthorized control or configuration of the printing server."
