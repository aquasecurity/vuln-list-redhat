  "details": [
    "Mutt before 1.5.20 patch 7 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service via a series of requests to mutt temporary files.",
    "An insecure temporary file vulnerability was found in the way mutt created temporary files under /tmp. Specifically, mutt created temporary files in an insecure way, using only predictable elements such as the hostname, user ID (uid) and process ID (pid). A local attacker could exploit this flaw to create those temporary files beforehand, causing a denial of service by preventing the user from using mutt."
