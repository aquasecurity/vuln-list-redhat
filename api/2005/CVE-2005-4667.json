More information regarding issue severity can be found here:\nhttp://www.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is not vulnerable to this issue as it contains a backported patch.\nThe risks associated with fixing this bug are greater than the low severity security risk. We therefore currently have no plans to fix this flaw in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 which is in maintenance mode.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Buffer overflow in UnZip 5.50 and earlier allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long filename command line argument.  NOTE: since the overflow occurs in a non-setuid program, there are not many scenarios under which it poses a vulnerability, unless unzip is passed long arguments when it is invoked from other programs."
