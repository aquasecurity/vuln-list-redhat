There is no component shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 using OpenSSLs DTLS implementation, except for OpenSSLs testing command line client - openssl.",

  "details": [
    "Use-after-free vulnerability in the dtls1_retrieve_buffered_fragment function in ssl/d1_both.c in OpenSSL 1.0.0 Beta 2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (openssl s_client crash) and possibly have unspecified other impact via a DTLS packet, as demonstrated by a packet from a server that uses a crafted server certificate."
