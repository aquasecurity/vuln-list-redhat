  "statement": "This issue did not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as the affected code has been removed. It was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1386.html. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is now in Production 3 of the maintenance life-cycle, https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/, therefore the fix for this issue is not currently planned to be included in the future updates.",

    "Buffer overflow in the auerswald_probe function in the Auerswald Linux USB driver for the Linux kernel before 2.6.27 allows physically proximate attackers to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service via a crafted USB device, or take full control of the system."
