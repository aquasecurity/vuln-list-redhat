There is no component shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 using OpenSSLs DTLS implementation, except for OpenSSLs testing command line client - openssl.",

    "Multiple memory leaks in the dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message function in ssl/d1_both.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8k and earlier 0.9.8 versions allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via DTLS records that (1) are duplicates or (2) have sequence numbers much greater than current sequence numbers, aka \"DTLS fragment handling memory leak.\""
