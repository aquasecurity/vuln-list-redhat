  "statement": "This issue is only security-relevant in PostgreSQL versions 8.4 and later as previous versions did not compare the connection host name with the certificate CommonName at all. Client certificate authentication was introduced in version 8.4. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier provided PostgreSQL versions 8.1.x and earlier, and are thus not affected by this issue.",

  "details": [
    "PostgreSQL 7.4.x before 7.4.27, 8.0.x before 8.0.23, 8.1.x before 8.1.19, 8.2.x before 8.2.15, 8.3.x before 8.3.9, and 8.4.x before 8.4.2 does not properly handle a '\\0' character in a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which (1) allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL-based PostgreSQL servers via a crafted server certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, and (2) allows remote attackers to bypass intended client-hostname restrictions via a crafted client certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408."
