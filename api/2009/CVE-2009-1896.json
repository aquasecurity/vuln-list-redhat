    "The Java Web Start framework in IcedTea in OpenJDK before 1.6.0.0-20.b16.fc10 on Fedora 10, and before 1.6.0.0-27.b16.fc11 on Fedora 11, trusts an entire application when at least one of the listed jar files is trusted, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code without the untrusted-code restrictions via a crafted application, related to NetX."
