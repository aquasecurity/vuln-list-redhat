  "statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, or Red Hat Enterprise MRG, as the affected driver is not enabled in these kernels.\nThe affected driver is available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, but only if the kernel-unsupported package is installed.\nFuture kernel update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 may address this flaw.",
