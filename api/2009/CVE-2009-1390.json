  "details": [
    "Mutt 1.5.19, when linked against (1) OpenSSL (mutt_ssl.c) or (2) GnuTLS (mutt_ssl_gnutls.c), allows connections when only one TLS certificate in the chain is accepted instead of verifying the entire chain, which allows remote attackers to spoof trusted servers via a man-in-the-middle attack."
