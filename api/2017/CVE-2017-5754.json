The combination of limited address space in 32-bit environments plus the mechanism for passing control from the userspace to kernel and limitations on the stack during this transfer make the projected changes too invasive and disruptive for deployments that require the highest level of system stability.  By contrast, 32-bit Meltdown mitigations have been delivered for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, where the changes are far less invasive and risky.",

  "name": "CVE-2017-5754",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis of the data cache.",
    "An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited. Variant CVE-2017-5754 relies on the fact that, on impacted microprocessors, during speculative execution of instruction permission faults, exception generation triggered by a faulting access is suppressed until the retirement of the whole instruction block. In a combination with the fact that memory accesses may populate the cache even when the block is being dropped and never committed (executed), an unprivileged local attacker could use this flaw to read privileged (kernel space) memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. Note: CVE-2017-5754 affects Intel x86-64 microprocessors. AMD x86-64 microprocessors are not affected by this issue."
