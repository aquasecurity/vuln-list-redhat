  "statement": "This vulnerability is classified as low severity instead of moderate because it primarily results in a race condition that can cause unexpected behavior or crashes but does not directly lead to memory corruption, information disclosure, or remote code execution. \nThe issue is constrained to scenarios where multiple threads interact with SSLContext during certificate loading, which is an uncommon pattern in typical applications. Additionally, exploitation would require precise timing and a specific application design that exposes these methods to concurrent access, reducing the likelihood of real-world impact.",

    "A defect was discovered in the Python “ssl” module where there is a memory\nrace condition with the ssl.SSLContext methods “cert_store_stats()” and\n“get_ca_certs()”. The race condition can be triggered if the methods are\ncalled at the same time as certificates are loaded into the SSLContext,\nsuch as during the TLS handshake with a certificate directory configured.\nThis issue is fixed in CPython 3.10.14, 3.11.9, 3.12.3, and 3.13.0a5.",
