    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ndrm/amd/display: Check pipe offset before setting vblank\npipe_ctx has a size of MAX_PIPES so checking its index before accessing\nthe array.\nThis fixes an OVERRUN issue reported by Coverity.",
    "A vulnerability in the DRM/AMD/display subsystem in the Linux Kernel was resolved by adding a check for the `pipe_ctx` index before accessing the `vblank` array. This fix addresses an out-of-bounds access issue reported by Coverity, preventing potential memory corruption and enhancing system stability. The check ensures that the index is within the valid range, safeguarding against buffer overruns."
