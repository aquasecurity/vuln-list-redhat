  "statement": "The issue of incorrect digital signature validation during the repair of corrupt zip files in LibreOffice is classified as moderate severity due to its specific conditions and limited impact. While the flaw could potentially allow an attacker to exploit the repair mechanism to bypass signature verification, it requires both the corruption of a zip file and the presence of a digital signature, which narrows the scope of exploitation. Furthermore, successful exploitation would only affect the validation of the signature status rather than directly compromising the integrity or security of the document's content.",

    "Improper Digital Signature Invalidation  vulnerability in Zip Repair Mode of The Document Foundation LibreOffice allows Signature forgery vulnerability in LibreOfficeThis issue affects LibreOffice: from 24.2 before \u003c 24.2.5.",
    "A flaw was found in LibreOffice. Various file formats are based on the zip file format. In cases of corruption of the underlying zip's central directory, LibreOffice offers a \"repair mode\" which will attempt to recover the zip file structure by scanning for secondary local file headers in the zip to reconstruct the document. Prior to this fix, in the case of digitally signed zip files, an attacker could construct a document which, when repaired, reported a signature status not valid for the recovered file."
