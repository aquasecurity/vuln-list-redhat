  "details": [
    "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An uninitialized stack variable vulnerability has been identified in the gst_matroska_demux_add_wvpk_header function within matroska-demux.c. When size \u003c 4, the program calls gst_buffer_unmap with an uninitialized map variable. Then, in the gst_memory_unmap function, the program will attempt to unmap the buffer using the uninitialized map variable, causing a function pointer hijack, as it will jump to mem-\u003eallocator-\u003emem_unmap_full or mem-\u003eallocator-\u003emem_unmap. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to hijack the execution flow, potentially leading to code execution. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
    "A flaw was found in the GStreamer library. Usage of uninitialized stack memory in the Matroska/WebM demuxer can result in calls to uninitialized function pointers and crashes. This flaw allows a malicious third party to trigger an application crash or potentially allow code execution through stack manipulation."
