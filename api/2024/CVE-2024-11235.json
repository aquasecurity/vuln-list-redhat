    "In PHP versions 8.3.* before 8.3.19 and 8.4.* before 8.4.5, a code sequence involving __set handler or ??=  operator and exceptions can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. If the third party can control the memory layout leading to this, for example by supplying specially crafted inputs to the script, it could lead to remote code execution.",
    "A flaw was found in PHP. This vulnerability allows remote code execution via a crafted code path involving the __set magic method or the null coalescing assignment (??=) operator, in combination with exception handling. Attackers can trigger a use-after-free condition by controlling the memory layout through specially crafted inputs."
