    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nRevert \"mm/writeback: fix possible divide-by-zero in wb_dirty_limits(), again\"\nPatch series \"mm: Avoid possible overflows in dirty throttling\".\nDirty throttling logic assumes dirty limits in page units fit into\n32-bits.  This patch series makes sure this is true (see patch 2/2 for\nmore details).\nThis patch (of 2):\nThis reverts commit 9319b647902cbd5cc884ac08a8a6d54ce111fc78.\nThe commit is broken in several ways.  Firstly, the removed (u64) cast\nfrom the multiplication will introduce a multiplication overflow on 32-bit\narchs if wb_thresh * bg_thresh \u003e= 1\u003c\u003c32 (which is actually common - the\ndefault settings with 4GB of RAM will trigger this).  Secondly, the\ndiv64_u64() is unnecessarily expensive on 32-bit archs.  We have\ndiv64_ul() in case we want to be safe \u0026 cheap.  Thirdly, if dirty\nthresholds are larger than 1\u003c\u003c32 pages, then dirty balancing is going to\nblow up in many other spectacular ways anyway so trying to fix one\npossible overflow is just moot.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the wb_dirty_limits() function in the Linux kernel, where a removed (u64) cast in the dtc-\u003ewb_thresh * dtc-\u003ebg_thresh operation can result in multiplication overflow on 32-bit architectures. This issue could lead to memory corruption or performance issues."
