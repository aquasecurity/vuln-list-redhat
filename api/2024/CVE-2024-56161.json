This flaw allows an attacker with system administrator privileges to exploit a flaw in the microcode signature verification, enabling the loading of malicious microcode. This issue could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of guest VMs protected by AMD’s Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), undermining its security."
