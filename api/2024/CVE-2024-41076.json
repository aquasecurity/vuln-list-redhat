  "statement": "Red Hat believes this flaw to be of low severity as the only effect of this vulnerability is to lead to memory leakage which, called repeatedly over time, may lead to memory exhaustion and impact the system's performance. Given that the max xattr size on NFSv4 systems is quite small (typically 1KB; and security xattrs tend to be significantly smaller) it is safe to assume that a system's availability being impacted solely from memory exhaustion caused by this vulnerability is unlikely and thus its impact is low.",

  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nNFSv4: Fix memory leak in nfs4_set_security_label\nWe leak nfs_fattr and nfs4_label every time we set a security xattr.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the nfs4_set_security_label() in the Linux kernel, where the function fails to free the nfs_fattr attribute before exiting, leaving said memory allocation present. As the nfs4_set_security_label() is called repeatedly over time, this may lead to memory exhaustion."
