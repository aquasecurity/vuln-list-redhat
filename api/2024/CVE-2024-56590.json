  "statement": "This vulnerability, rated as moderate severity, involves a flaw in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem. A failure to validate the socket buffer's length before accessing ACL headers can lead to out-of-bounds memory access. This creates a risk of kernel memory corruption, potentially allowing attackers to corrupt kernel memory related to bluetooth networking, which might impact the functionality of connected devices. However, even in situations where an attacker had significant access to and information about a target system, our assessment indicates that the security features of the kernel would prevent a compromise of confidentiality or the ability to escalate their privileges.",
