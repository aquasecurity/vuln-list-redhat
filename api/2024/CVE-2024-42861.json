  "statement": "This vulnerability is categorized as a Moderate severity rather than Important because it specifically targets the time synchronization function on a single port rather than causing broader system or network compromise. The attack requires the attacker to be on the same Ethernet network, limiting its scope and accessibility. Additionally, the denial of service is temporary, affecting synchronization only for a limited duration, after which normal operation may resume without permanent damage to the system.",
