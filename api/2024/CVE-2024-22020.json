  "statement": "This vulnerability is categorized as moderate severity rather than high due to its specific conditions for exploitation and impact scope. While the flaw permits bypassing network import restrictions via data URLs to execute arbitrary code, its exploitation is contingent on the attackerâ€™s ability to inject and execute code within a controlled environment. The impact is constrained to scenarios where the vulnerable application processes data URLs and lacks robust validation mechanisms. Additionally, this issue requires the attacker to exploit specific code paths and permissions, which limits its widespread applicability.",

  "details": [
    "A security flaw in Node.js  allows a bypass of network import restrictions.\nBy embedding non-network imports in data URLs, an attacker can execute arbitrary code, compromising system security.\nVerified on various platforms, the vulnerability is mitigated by forbidding data URLs in network imports.\nExploiting this flaw can violate network import security, posing a risk to developers and servers.",
