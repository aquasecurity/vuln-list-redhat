  "statement": "To exploit this flaw, an attacker needs to trick a user into running grub2 with a specially crafted BFS file system image, limiting the exposure of this flaw. For this reason, this vulnerability has been rated with a Moderate severity.\nThe grub2 package as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, 8, 9 and in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 is not affected by this vulnerability because the BFS module is not built, so this issue is not applicable.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "An integer overflow flaw was found in the BFS file system driver in grub2. When reading a file with an indirect extent map, grub2 fails to validate the number of extent entries to be read. A crafted or corrupted BFS filesystem may cause an integer overflow during the file reading, leading to a heap of bounds read. As a consequence, sensitive data may be leaked, or grub2 will crash.",
