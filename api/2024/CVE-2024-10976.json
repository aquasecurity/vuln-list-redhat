  "details": [
    "Incomplete tracking in PostgreSQL of tables with row security allows a reused query to view or change different rows from those intended.  CVE-2023-2455 and CVE-2016-2193 fixed most interaction between row security and user ID changes.  They missed cases where a subquery, WITH query, security invoker view, or SQL-language function references a table with a row-level security policy.  This has the same consequences as the two earlier CVEs.  That is to say, it leads to potentially incorrect policies being applied in cases where role-specific policies are used and a given query is planned under one role and then executed under other roles.  This scenario can happen under security definer functions or when a common user and query is planned initially and then re-used across multiple SET ROLEs.  Applying an incorrect policy may permit a user to complete otherwise-forbidden reads and modifications.  This affects only databases that have used CREATE POLICY to define a row security policy.  An attacker must tailor an attack to a particular application's pattern of query plan reuse, user ID changes, and role-specific row security policies.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21 are affected.",
    "A flaw was found in PostgreSQL. This vulnerability allows incorrect row-level security policies to be applied via subqueries, WITH queries, security invoker views, or SQL-language functions that reference tables with row-level security policies. This issue arises when a query is planned under one role and executed under another, potentially leading to unauthorized reads or modifications of data."
