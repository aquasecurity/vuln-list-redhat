  "details": [
    "[REJECTED CVE] A vulnerability was identified in the ext4 filesystem of the Linux kernel, where a race condition in buffer_head read fault injection could lead to clearing the buffer_uptodate flag on active buffers. This occurred due to a non-atomic interaction between buffer read completion and fault injection, potentially causing inode bitmap read failures and warnings. An attacker with control over fault injection mechanisms could exploit this issue to trigger filesystem inconsistencies or denial-of-service (DoS) conditions by forcing invalid buffer states, leading to unexpected crashes or errors."
