  "details": [
    "CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and `libcupsfilters` contains the code of the filters of the former `cups-filters` package as library functions to be used for the data format conversion tasks needed in Printer Applications. The `cfGetPrinterAttributes5` function in `libcupsfilters` does not sanitize IPP attributes returned from an IPP server. When these IPP attributes are used, for instance, to generate a PPD file, this can lead to attacker controlled data to be provided to the rest of the CUPS system.",
    "A flaw was found in OpenPrinting CUPS. In certain conditions, a remote attacker can add a malicious printer or directly hijack an existing printer by replacing the valid IPP URL with a malicious one. Also, it is possible that due to a lack of validation of IPP attributes returned by the server, this issue allows attacker-controlled data to be used on the rest of the CUPS system."
