  "statement": "This vulnerability in Ghostscript, while serious, is considered moderate rather than important due to several mitigating factors. First, exploitation requires specific conditions, including the ability to supply a crafted PS file with a malicious PDFPassword containing a NULL byte. This restricts the attack surface primarily to scenarios where untrusted PS files are processed. Additionally, the issue does not directly lead to remote code execution or privilege escalation without further exploitation techniques. Instead, it results in a heap buffer overflow, which can be challenging to exploit reliably due to modern memory protection mechanisms.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-29509",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Artifex Ghostscript before 10.03.0 has a heap-based overflow when PDFPassword (e.g., for runpdf) has a \\000 byte in the middle.",
    "A flaw was found in Ghostscript. The `runpdf` command allowed the new C-based PDF interpreter to be invoked from within PS. With this, it can pass various flags and arguments (for example, see `pdf_impl_set_param`) normally passed via the command line when the PDF interpreter is invoked directly. Because PS-strings are not null-terminated, this issue will result in a heap buffer overflow when a value of `PDFPassword` is supplied with a NULL byte in the middle."
