  "name": "CVE-2024-8006",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Remote packet capture support is disabled by default in libpcap.  When a user builds libpcap with remote packet capture support enabled, one of the functions that become available is pcap_findalldevs_ex().  One of the function arguments can be a filesystem path, which normally means a directory with input data files.  When the specified path cannot be used as a directory, the function receives NULL from opendir(), but does not check the return value and passes the NULL value to readdir(), which causes a NULL pointer derefence.",
    "A flaw was found in the libpcap library. When remote packet capture support is enabled, it is possible to trigger a NULL pointer dereference when a filesystem path that is not a directory is used as an argument to the pcap_findalldevs_ex function due to a missing check of the return value from the opendir function, resulting in a denial of service."
