  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nmmc: davinci_mmc: Prevent transmitted data size from exceeding sgm's length\nNo check is done on the size of the data to be transmiited. This causes\na kernel panic when this size exceeds the sg_miter's length.\nLimit the number of transmitted bytes to sgm-\u003elength.",
    "A flaw was found in the `davinci_mmc` driver in the Linux kernel, which lacks validation for the size of transmitted data, leading to potential kernel panics if the data size exceeded the scatter-gather list (`sg_miter`) length. This issue was addressed by adding a check to limit the transmitted data to the `sgm-\u003elength`, preventing buffer overflows and enhancing system stability."
