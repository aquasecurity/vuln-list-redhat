    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nASoC: fsl-asoc-card: set priv-\u003epdev before using it\npriv-\u003epdev pointer was set after being used in\nfsl_asoc_card_audmux_init().\nMove this assignment at the start of the probe function, so\nsub-functions can correctly use pdev through priv.\nfsl_asoc_card_audmux_init() dereferences priv-\u003epdev to get access to the\ndev struct, used with dev_err macros.\nAs priv is zero-initialised, there would be a NULL pointer dereference.\nNote that if priv-\u003edev is dereferenced before assignment but never used,\nfor example if there is no error to be printed, the driver won't crash\nprobably due to compiler optimisations.",
    "A flaw was found in the `fsl-asoc-card` driver in the Linux kernel. This issue was fixed by ensuring the `priv-\u003epdev` pointer is initialized before use. Previously, `priv-\u003epdev` was used in the `fsl_asoc_card_audmux_init()` function before being assigned, potentially leading to a NULL pointer dereference and subsequent crashes."
