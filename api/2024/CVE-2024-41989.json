  "statement": "This issue is categorized as moderate severity rather than important because, while it has the potential to cause significant memory consumption under specific conditions, the likelihood of such a scenario occurring in typical applications is relatively low. The issue arises primarily when processing extremely large numbers in scientific notation, which is not a common use case in most Django applications. Additionally, the impact is localized to the floatformat function, and the issue does not expose sensitive data or compromise the integrity of the application.",

  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.8 and 4.2 before 4.2.15. The floatformat template filter is subject to significant memory consumption when given a string representation of a number in scientific notation with a large exponent.",
    "A security issue was found in Django. If 'floatformat' received a string representation of a number in scientific notation with a large exponent, it could lead to significant memory consumption. To avoid this, decimals with more than 200 digits are now returned as is."
