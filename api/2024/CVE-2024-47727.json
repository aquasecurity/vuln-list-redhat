  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nx86/tdx: Fix \"in-kernel MMIO\" check\nTDX only supports kernel-initiated MMIO operations. The handle_mmio()\nfunction checks if the #VE exception occurred in the kernel and rejects\nthe operation if it did not.\nHowever, userspace can deceive the kernel into performing MMIO on its\nbehalf. For example, if userspace can point a syscall to an MMIO address,\nsyscall does get_user() or put_user() on it, triggering MMIO #VE. The\nkernel will treat the #VE as in-kernel MMIO.\nEnsure that the target MMIO address is within the kernel before decoding\ninstruction.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. Userspace can deceive the kernel into performing MMIO (Memory-Mapped IO) operations in TDX (Trust Domain Extensions) on its behalf, allowing a #VE (Virtualization Exception) to be incorrectly handled as a in-kernel MMIO operation."
