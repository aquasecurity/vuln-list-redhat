    "A flaw was found in the OpenShift Console, an endpoint for plugins to serve resources in multiple languages: /locales/resources.json. This endpoint's lng and ns parameters are used to construct a filepath in pkg/plugins/handlers unsafely.go#L112 Because of this unsafe filepath construction, an authenticated user can manipulate the path to retrieve any JSON files on the console's pod by using sequences of ../ and valid directory paths."
