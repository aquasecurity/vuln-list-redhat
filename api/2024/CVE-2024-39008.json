    "robinweser fast-loops v1.1.3 was discovered to contain a prototype pollution via the function objectMergeDeep. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via injecting arbitrary properties.",
    "A flaw was found in the fast-loops Node.js package. This flaw allows an attacker to alter the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype by passing arguments to the objectMergeDeep function crafted with the built-in property: __proto__. This issue can potentially lead to a denial of service, remote code execution, or Cross-site scripting."
