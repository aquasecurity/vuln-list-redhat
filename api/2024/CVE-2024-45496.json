  "statement": "In all versions of OpenShift, the \"Custom\" build strategy gives developers permission to run arbitrary commands in a privileged container. This is disabled by default, and documentation explicitly warns that this should only be enabled for highly trusted users (eg: cluster admins). We therefore do not consider this vulnerability a privilege escalation path for \"Custom\" strategy builds.\nMicroshift is not affected by this vulnerability. MicroShift does not include this OpenShift API.\nThe Builds for Red Hat OpenShift Operator based on Shipwright is not affected by this vulnerability.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in OpenShift. This issue occurs due to the misuse of elevated privileges in the OpenShift Container Platform's build process. During the build initialization step, the git-clone container is run with a privileged security context, allowing unrestricted access to the node. An attacker with developer-level access can provide a crafted .gitconfig file containing commands executed during the cloning process, leading to arbitrary command execution on the worker node. An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their permissions on the node running the container."
