    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nSquashfs: sanity check symbolic link size\nSyzkiller reports a \"KMSAN: uninit-value in pick_link\" bug.\nThis is caused by an uninitialised page, which is ultimately caused\nby a corrupted symbolic link size read from disk.\nThe reason why the corrupted symlink size causes an uninitialised\npage is due to the following sequence of events:\n1. squashfs_read_inode() is called to read the symbolic\nlink from disk.  This assigns the corrupted value\n3875536935 to inode-\u003ei_size.\n2. Later squashfs_symlink_read_folio() is called, which assigns\nthis corrupted value to the length variable, which being a\nsigned int, overflows producing a negative number.\n3. The following loop that fills in the page contents checks that\nthe copied bytes is less than length, which being negative means\nthe loop is skipped, producing an uninitialised page.\nThis patch adds a sanity check which checks that the symbolic\nlink size is not larger than expected.\n--\nV2: fix spelling mistake.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel involving the use of uninitialized resources. When a corrupted symbolic link size read is called from the disk, it causes an uninitialized page, resulting in loss of availability of the system."
