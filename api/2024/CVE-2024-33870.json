  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in Artifex Ghostscript before 10.03.1. There is path traversal (via a crafted PostScript document) to arbitrary files if the current directory is in the permitted paths. For example, there can be a transformation of ../../foo to ./../../foo and this will grant access if ./ is permitted.",
    "A flaw was found in Ghostscript. When the `gp_validate_path_len` function validates a path, it distinguishes between absolute and relative paths. In the case of relative paths, it will check the path with and without the current-directory-prefix (\"foo\" and \"./foo\"). This does not take into account paths with a parent-directory-prefix. Therefore, a path like \"../../foo\" is also tested as \"./../../foo\" and if the current directory \"./\" is in the permitted paths, it will pass the check, which may allow arbitrary file access."
