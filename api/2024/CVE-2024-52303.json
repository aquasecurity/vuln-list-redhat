  "statement": "This vulnerability in aiohttp is of important severity rather than moderate because it can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack via memory exhaustion. An attacker can exploit the memory leak by sending a large number of crafted requests that trigger the `MatchInfoError`, causing unique cache entries to accumulate without being cleared. As a result, the server's memory resources are gradually depleted, potentially leading to system crashes or performance degradation. The impact can be significant, especially in high-traffic environments where attackers can send hundreds of thousands or millions of requests, making it a critical issue for any service relying on `aiohttp` for handling web requests, particularly those using middlewares.",
  "acknowledgement": "",
  "name": "CVE-2024-52303",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. In versions starting with 3.10.6 and prior to 3.10.11, a memory leak can occur when a request produces a MatchInfoError. This was caused by adding an entry to a cache on each request, due to the building of each MatchInfoError producing a unique cache entry. An attacker may be able to exhaust the memory resources of a server by sending a substantial number (100,000s to millions) of such requests. Those who use any middlewares with aiohttp.web should upgrade to version 3.10.11 to receive a patch.",
    "A flaw was found in the aiohttp package. A memory leak can occur in certain configurations when a request produces a `MatchInfoError`. This issue was caused by adding an entry to a cache on each request due to the building of each `MatchInfoError` producing a unique cache entry. An attacker may be able to exhaust the memory resources of a server by sending a substantial number (100,000s to millions) of such requests."
