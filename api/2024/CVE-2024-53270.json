  "statement": "This vulnerability in Envoy Proxy is marked as important severity rather than moderate due to its ability to cause a null pointer dereference, leading to a complete crash of the proxy under specific conditions. As Envoy is commonly deployed in mission-critical roles such as a high-performance edge, middle, or service proxy, a crash can disrupt downstream and upstream communication, effectively bringing down services dependent on Envoy. The issue is exacerbated by its potential to occur during load shedding, a mechanism typically invoked during resource exhaustion, which is a critical time for maintaining service availability.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-53270",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In affected versions `sendOverloadError` is going to assume the active request exists when `envoy.load_shed_points.http1_server_abort_dispatch` is configured. If `active_request` is nullptr, only onMessageBeginImpl() is called. However, the `onMessageBeginImpl` will directly return ok status if the stream is already reset leading to the nullptr reference. The downstream reset can actually happen during the H/2 upstream reset. As a result envoy may crash. This issue has been addressed in releases 1.32.3, 1.31.5, 1.30.9, and 1.29.12. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable `http1_server_abort_dispatch` load shed point and/or use a high threshold.",
    "A flaw was found in Envoy. In systems where `http1_server_abort_dispatch` is configured, Envoy does not properly handle the control flow during H1 stream resets. This can trigger a null pointer error and lead to an application crash."
