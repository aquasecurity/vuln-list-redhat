    "Next.js is a React Framework for the Web. Cersions on the 10.x, 11.x, 12.x, 13.x, and 14.x branches before version 14.2.7 contain a vulnerability in the image optimization feature which allows for a potential Denial of Service (DoS) condition which could lead to excessive CPU consumption. Neither the `next.config.js` file that is configured with `images.unoptimized` set to `true` or `images.loader` set to a non-default value nor the Next.js application that is hosted on Vercel are affected. This issue was fully patched in Next.js `14.2.7`. As a workaround, ensure that the `next.config.js` file has either `images.unoptimized`, `images.loader` or `images.loaderFile` assigned.",
