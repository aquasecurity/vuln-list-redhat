  "details": [
    "[REJECTED CVE] A vulnerability was identified in the Linux kernel's nct6775-core hardware monitoring (hwmon) driver, where writing large values (e.g., 18446744073709551615) to limit attributes could cause an overflow due to improper ordering of DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST() and clamp_val(). This flaw allowed unintended behavior when setting sensor limits, potentially leading to incorrect readings or improper thermal and voltage regulation. Exploitation required local user privileges to write to the relevant sysfs attributes."
