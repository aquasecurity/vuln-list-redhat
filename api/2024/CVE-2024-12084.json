  "statement": "Red Hat rates this flaw to have critical severity because it allows an attacker to exploit a heap-based buffer overflow by supplying a malicious s2length value during checksum parsing. The ability to write up to 48 bytes beyond the bounds of the sum2 buffer enables overwriting adjacent memory on the heap, which can lead to arbitrary code execution under specific heap conditions. Since rsync is often used in network-facing and automated environments, a remote attacker could craft a malicious protocol negotiation to trigger this vulnerability, potentially compromising the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the system.\nKeep in mind that rsync's default rsyncd configuration allows anonymous file syncing, which is at risk of this vulnerability. Otherwise, an attacker will need valid credentials for servers which require authentication.\nThe combination of memory corruption, remote exploitation, and the potential for system takeover for a default configuration elevates this issue to critical severity.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the rsync daemon. This issue is due to improper handling of attacker-controlled checksum lengths (s2length) in the code. When MAX_DIGEST_LEN exceeds the fixed SUM_LENGTH (16 bytes), an attacker can write out of bounds in the sum2 buffer."
