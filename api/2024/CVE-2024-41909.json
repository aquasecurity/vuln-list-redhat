  "statement": "Above CVE is classified as a moderate severity issue rather than an important one due to its reliance on specific conditions for exploitation. The vulnerability, known as a Terrapin attack, requires an attacker to have the capability to intercept and manipulate packets between the SSH client and server. This level of access is not commonly available in most network environments, reducing the likelihood of widespread exploitation. Additionally, the impact of the attack—where security features may be downgraded or disabled—depends on the attacker's ability to perform packet drops without detection, which further limits the potential for significant damage.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Like many other SSH implementations, Apache MINA SSHD suffered from the issue that is more widely known as CVE-2023-48795. An attacker that can intercept traffic between client and server could drop certain packets from the stream, potentially causing client and server to consequently end up with a connection for which \nsome security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin \nattack\nThe mitigations to prevent this type of attack were implemented in Apache MINA SSHD 2.12.0, both client and server side. Users are recommended to upgrade to at least this version. Note that both the client and the server implementation must have mitigations applied against this issue, otherwise the connection may still be affected.",
