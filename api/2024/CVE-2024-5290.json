  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in Ubuntu wpa_supplicant that resulted in loading of arbitrary shared objects, which allows a local unprivileged attacker to escalate privileges to the user that wpa_supplicant runs as (usually root).\nMembership in the netdev group or access to the dbus interface of wpa_supplicant allow an unprivileged user to specify an arbitrary path to a module to be loaded by the wpa_supplicant process; other escalation paths might exist.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the wpa_supplicant package. This flaw allows a local unprivileged user who is part of the netdev group to achieve privilege escalation to the same user running wpa_supplicant (typically root)."
