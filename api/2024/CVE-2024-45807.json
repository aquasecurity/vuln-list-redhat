  "statement": "The issue in Envoy, where the use of the `oghttp2` codec leads to potential crashes due to stream management bugs, is classified as a moderate severity vulnerability rather than an important because the crash occurs only under specific conditions related to HTTP/2 stream management, which may not be triggered in typical use cases, thereby limiting its immediate impact on most deployments.",

  "details": [
    "Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. Envoy's 1.31 is using `oghttp` as the default HTTP/2 codec, and there are potential bugs around stream management in the codec. To resolve this Envoy will switch off the `oghttp2` by default. The impact of this issue is that envoy will crash. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.31.2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
