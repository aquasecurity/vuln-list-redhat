  "details": [
    "A vulnerability was found in moby/moby. The classic builder cache system in moby is vulnerable to cache poisoning if the image is built using a 'FROM scratch' in Dockerfile. This flaw allows an attacker who has knowledge of the Dockerfile to create a malicious cache that would be pulled and considered a valid cache candidate for some build steps.\nThis only affects one if using DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 or using the /build API endpoint."
