  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nAvoid hw_desc array overrun in dw-axi-dmac\nI have a use case where nr_buffers = 3 and in which each descriptor is composed by 3\nsegments, resulting in the DMA channel descs_allocated to be 9. Since axi_desc_put()\nhandles the hw_desc considering the descs_allocated, this scenario would result in a\nkernel panic (hw_desc array will be overrun).\nTo fix this, the proposal is to add a new member to the axi_dma_desc structure,\nwhere we keep the number of allocated hw_descs (axi_desc_alloc()) and use it in\naxi_desc_put() to handle the hw_desc array correctly.\nAdditionally I propose to remove the axi_chan_start_first_queued() call after completing\nthe transfer, since it was identified that unbalance can occur (started descriptors can\nbe interrupted and transfer ignored due to DMA channel not being enabled).",
    "A vulnerability was found in `dw-axi-dmac` in the Linux kernel and has been resolved to prevent an overrun of the `hw_desc` array. This issue occurred when using three descriptors, each comprising three segments, resulting in nine allocated descriptors."
