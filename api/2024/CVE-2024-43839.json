    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nbna: adjust 'name' buf size of bna_tcb and bna_ccb structures\nTo have enough space to write all possible sprintf() args. Currently\n'name' size is 16, but the first '%s' specifier may already need at\nleast 16 characters, since 'bnad-\u003enetdev-\u003ename' is used there.\nFor '%d' specifiers, assume that they require:\n* 1 char for 'tx_id + tx_info-\u003etcb[i]-\u003eid' sum, BNAD_MAX_TXQ_PER_TX is 8\n* 2 chars for 'rx_id + rx_info-\u003erx_ctrl[i].ccb-\u003eid', BNAD_MAX_RXP_PER_RX\nis 16\nAnd replace sprintf with snprintf.\nDetected using the static analysis tool - Svace.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel involving insufficient buffer size in the bna_tcb and bna_ccb structures. The buffer, named name, was originally 16 bytes, which was inadequate for all possible sprintf() arguments, especially when handling %s and %d specifiers. This limitation could potentially lead to buffer overflows."
