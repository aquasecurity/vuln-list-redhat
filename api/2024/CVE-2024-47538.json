  "statement": "To exploit this flaw, an attacker needs to trick a user into opening or processing a specially crafted .ogg file. However, this issue still has an important severity as it allows an attacker to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow and overwrite critical memory regions, including the return address of control data, potentially resulting in unexpected behavior, including arbitrary code execution.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-47538",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A stack-buffer overflow has been detected in the vorbis_handle_identification_packet function within gstvorbisdec.c. The position array is a stack-allocated buffer of size 64. If vd-\u003evi.channels exceeds 64, the for loop will write beyond the boundaries of the position array The value written will always be GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE. This vulnerability allows to overwrite the EIP address allocated in the stack. Additionally, this bug can overwrite the GstAudioInfo info structure. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10."
