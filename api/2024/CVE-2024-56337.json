  "statement": "This vulnerability marked as Important rather than Moderate due to its potential to allow Remote Code Execution (RCE) when specific conditions are met, such as running on a case-insensitive file system with a misconfigured default servlet (`readonly=false`). RCE vulnerabilities are particularly important because they allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. Additionally, the dependency on file system behavior and Java runtime configurations adds complexity to mitigation, increasing the likelihood of exploitation in misconfigured environments.\nThe default `readonly` initialization parameter value is `true` and not vulnerable to this issue.\nThe Tomcat package as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 is not affected by this vulnerability because the vulnerable code was introduced in a newer Tomcat version.\nRed Hat Satellite is not directed impacted by this issue as it does not include the affected Tomcat package. However, Tomcat is consumed by Candlepin, a component of Satellite. Red Hat Satellite users are advised to check the impact state of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as any necessary fixes will be distributed through the platform.",

    "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.1, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.33, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.97.\nThe mitigation for CVE-2024-50379 was incomplete.\nUsers running Tomcat on a case insensitive file system with the default servlet write enabled (readonly initialisation \nparameter set to the non-default value of false) may need additional configuration to fully mitigate CVE-2024-50379 depending on which version of Java they are using with Tomcat:\n- running on Java 8 or Java 11: the system property sun.io.useCanonCaches must be explicitly set to false (it defaults to true)\n- running on Java 17: the system property sun.io.useCanonCaches, if set, must be set to false (it defaults to false)\n- running on Java 21 onwards: no further configuration is required (the system property and the problematic cache have been removed)\nTomcat 11.0.3, 10.1.35 and 9.0.99 onwards will include checks that sun.io.useCanonCaches is set appropriately before allowing the default servlet to be write enabled on a case insensitive file system. Tomcat will also set sun.io.useCanonCaches to false by default where it can.",
    "The fix for CVE-2024-50379 in Apache Tomcat was insufficient to mitigate the issue fully. A Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition occurs during JSP compilation on case-insensitive file systems when the default servlet is enabled for writing. This vulnerability allows an uploaded file to be treated as a JSP and executed, resulting in remote code execution."
