  "statement": "No Red Hat products are affected by this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability is marked as critical rather than important because it enables unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) with potential privilege escalation. The ZipSlip flaw allows an attacker to write arbitrary files, including modifying /etc/ld.so.preload, which forces the system to load a malicious shared library. This effectively hijacks all dynamically linked binaries, leading to persistent system compromise. Furthermore, the ability to establish a reverse shell provides the attacker full remote control, making exploitation trivial and highly impactful, especially in scenarios where the application processes untrusted ZIP archives.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-7773",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in Ollama, specifically in the parseFromZipFile function in server/model.go. This vulnerability allows remote code execution (RCE) via improper input validation when handling zip files, enabling directory traversal attacks (../) that allow an attacker to write arbitrary files to the file system."
