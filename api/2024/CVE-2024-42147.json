    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ncrypto: hisilicon/debugfs - Fix debugfs uninit process issue\nDuring the zip probe process, the debugfs failure does not stop\nthe probe. When debugfs initialization fails, jumping to the\nerror branch will also release regs, in addition to its own\nrollback operation.\nAs a result, it may be released repeatedly during the regs\nuninit process. Therefore, the null check needs to be added to\nthe regs uninit process."
