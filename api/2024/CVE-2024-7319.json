  "statement": "While this flaw leaks a password, which could reduce confidentiality, integrity, and availability, the impact to this triad is rated Low. This is because OpenStack can not be more broadly compromised for two reasons:\na) The host has separate authorization authority from the guest virtual machine\nb) The guest virtual machines that are configured by different stack configurations cannot be compromised\nTherefore, the overall impact of the flaw is rated Moderate.",
