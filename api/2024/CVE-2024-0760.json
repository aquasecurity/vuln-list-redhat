    "A malicious client can send many DNS messages over TCP, potentially causing the server to become unstable while the attack is in progress. The server may recover after the attack ceases. Use of ACLs will not mitigate the attack. \nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.18.1 through 9.18.27, 9.19.0 through 9.19.24, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.27-S1.",
    "A flaw was found in the bind9 package, where a malicious client may send many DNS messages over the TCP protocol, leading to instabilities on the server side and potentially causing a denial of service. The server will recover automatically once the attack ceases."
