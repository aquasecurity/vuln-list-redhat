  "statement": "This insufficient entropy vulnerability in the OpenShift Console's OAuth2 implementation is a important severity issue due to its potential to enable Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, allowing unauthorized third-party access to user accounts. The inefficiency in generating the state parameter undermines the primary defense mechanism against CSRF attacks, facilitating session hijacking and unauthorized data access. This vulnerability compromises the integrity and confidentiality of user data, posing significant risks to the overall security posture of the application.",

  "details": [
    "An insufficient entropy vulnerability was found in the Openshift Console. In the authorization code type and implicit grant type, the OAuth2 protocol is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack if the state parameter is used inefficiently. This flaw allows logging into the victim’s current application account using a third-party account without any restrictions.",
