  "details": [
    "Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. The algorithm used for parsing HTTP cookies in Tornado versions prior to 6.4.2 sometimes has quadratic complexity, leading to excessive CPU consumption when parsing maliciously-crafted cookie headers. This parsing occurs in the event loop thread and may block the processing of other requests. Version 6.4.2 fixes the issue.",
    "A flaw was found in Tornado's HTTP cookie parsing algorithm. This vulnerability allows excessive CPU consumption via maliciously crafted cookie headers, potentially blocking the processing of other requests."
