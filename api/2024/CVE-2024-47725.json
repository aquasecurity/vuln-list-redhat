  "details": [
    "[REJECTED CVE] An issue has been identified in the Linux Kernel's dm-verity module, which ensures integrity verification for block devices. This issue arises because dm-verity does not crash when an I/O error occurs. In certain scenarios, an attacker could exploit this behavior by crafting sectors that trigger errors, such as through the Write Uncorrectable command. This could potentially subvert security mechanisms, as some programs may behave unpredictably or fail to handle the resulting I/O errors (EIO) correctly, leading to unintended system behavior."
