  "statement": "This vulnerability in the systeminformation library is marked as a high-severity issue because it allows for the execution of arbitrary commands via an unsanitized SSID input passed to `cmd.exe`. Since this flaw can lead to remote code execution (RCE) or local privilege escalation, it provides an attacker with the potential to execute malicious scripts on the affected system.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-56334",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "systeminformation is a System and OS information library for node.js. In affected versions SSIDs are not sanitized when before they are passed as a parameter to cmd.exe in the `getWindowsIEEE8021x` function. This means that malicious content in the SSID can be executed as OS commands. This vulnerability may enable an attacker, depending on how the package is used, to perform remote code execution or local privilege escalation. This issue has been addressed in version 5.23.7 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
    "A flaw was found in the systeminformation library for Node.js. In Windows systems, the SSID parameter of the `getWindowsIEEE8021x` function is not sanitized before it is passed to cmd.exe. This may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target system."
