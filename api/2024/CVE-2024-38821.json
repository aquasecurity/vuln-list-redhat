  "statement": "This issue is classified as a moderate severity vulnerability because it impacts only specific configurations in Spring WebFlux applications and does not compromise dynamic or core application functionality. To exploit this vulnerability, the application must not only be using Spring WebFlux but must also serve static resources with non-permitAll authorization rules. Furthermore, the breach affects only static resources—such as CSS, JavaScript, or images—that, while potentially sensitive, do not contain dynamic, user-specific data or functional endpoints that interact directly with business logic.\nRed Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP/XP) is not affected by this issue, as they do not utilize Spring WebFlux or the associated static resources functionality, either at runtime or within distributed repositories. This architecture eliminates the conditions necessary for this vulnerability to be exploited.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-38821",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Spring WebFlux applications that have Spring Security authorization rules on static resources can be bypassed under certain circumstances.\nFor this to impact an application, all of the following must be true:\n*  It must be a WebFlux application\n*  It must be using Spring's static resources support\n*  It must have a non-permitAll authorization rule applied to the static resources support",
    "An authorization bypass vulnerability was found in Spring WebFlux applications, impacting static resources under specific conditions. If an application uses Spring's static resources support with restricted (non-permitAll) authorization rules, unauthorized access to these resources may be possible."
