    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnet: mediatek: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in dummy net_device handling\nMove the freeing of the dummy net_device from mtk_free_dev() to\nmtk_remove().\nPreviously, if alloc_netdev_dummy() failed in mtk_probe(),\neth-\u003edummy_dev would be NULL. The error path would then call\nmtk_free_dev(), which in turn called free_netdev() assuming dummy_dev\nwas allocated (but it was not), potentially causing a NULL pointer\ndereference.\nBy moving free_netdev() to mtk_remove(), we ensure it's only called when\nmtk_probe() has succeeded and dummy_dev is fully allocated. This\naddresses a potential NULL pointer dereference detected by Smatch[1].",
    "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Mediatek network driver. Previously, if `alloc_netdev_dummy()` failed in `mtk_probe()`, the error handling code might attempt to free a NULL `dummy_dev`, leading to a crash."
