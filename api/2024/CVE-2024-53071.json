    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ndrm/panthor: Be stricter about IO mapping flags\nThe current panthor_device_mmap_io() implementation has two issues:\n1. For mapping DRM_PANTHOR_USER_FLUSH_ID_MMIO_OFFSET,\npanthor_device_mmap_io() bails if VM_WRITE is set, but does not clear\nVM_MAYWRITE. That means userspace can use mprotect() to make the mapping\nwritable later on. This is a classic Linux driver gotcha.\nI don't think this actually has any impact in practice:\nWhen the GPU is powered, writes to the FLUSH_ID seem to be ignored; and\nwhen the GPU is not powered, the dummy_latest_flush page provided by the\ndriver is deliberately designed to not do any flushes, so the only thing\nwriting to the dummy_latest_flush could achieve would be to make *more*\nflushes happen.\n2. panthor_device_mmap_io() does not block MAP_PRIVATE mappings (which are\nmappings without the VM_SHARED flag).\nMAP_PRIVATE in combination with VM_MAYWRITE indicates that the VMA has\ncopy-on-write semantics, which for VM_PFNMAP are semi-supported but\nfairly cursed.\nIn particular, in such a mapping, the driver can only install PTEs\nduring mmap() by calling remap_pfn_range() (because remap_pfn_range()\nwants to **store the physical address of the mapped physical memory into\nthe vm_pgoff of the VMA**); installing PTEs later on with a fault\nhandler (as panthor does) is not supported in private mappings, and so\nif you try to fault in such a mapping, vmf_insert_pfn_prot() splats when\nit hits a BUG() check.\nFix it by clearing the VM_MAYWRITE flag (userspace writing to the FLUSH_ID\ndoesn't make sense) and requiring VM_SHARED (copy-on-write semantics for\nthe FLUSH_ID don't make sense).\nReproducers for both scenarios are in the notes of my patch on the mailing\nlist; I tested that these bugs exist on a Rock 5B machine.\nNote that I only compile-tested the patch, I haven't tested it; I don't\nhave a working kernel build setup for the test machine yet. Please test it\nbefore applying it."
