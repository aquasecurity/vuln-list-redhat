  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ncachefiles: Set object to close if ondemand_id \u003c 0 in copen\nIf copen is maliciously called in the user mode, it may delete the request\ncorresponding to the random id. And the request may have not been read yet.\nNote that when the object is set to reopen, the open request will be done\nwith the still reopen state in above case. As a result, the request\ncorresponding to this object is always skipped in select_req function, so\nthe read request is never completed and blocks other process.\nFix this issue by simply set object to close if its id \u003c 0 in copen.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the `cachefiles` subsystem in the Linux Kernel involving the `copen` function being misused with an `ondemand_id` less than 0. This could lead to the deletion of a request before it was read, causing the request to be skipped and blocking other processes. The issue was fixed by ensuring that if the `ondemand_id` is less than 0, the object is set to close. This prevents requests from being skipped and ensures proper handling and completion of read requests, maintaining system stability."
