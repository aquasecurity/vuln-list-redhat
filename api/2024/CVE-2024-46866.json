    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ndrm/xe/client: add missing bo locking in show_meminfo()\nbo_meminfo() wants to inspect bo state like tt and the ttm resource,\nhowever this state can change at any point leading to stuff like NPD and\nUAF, if the bo lock is not held. Grab the bo lock when calling\nbo_meminfo(), ensuring we drop any spinlocks first. In the case of\nobject_idr we now also need to hold a ref.\nv2 (MattB)\n- Also add xe_bo_assert_held()\n(cherry picked from commit 4f63d712fa104c3ebefcb289d1e733e86d8698c7)",
    "A vulnerability in the Linux kernel's `drm/xe/client` driver was resolved. This issue was resolved by adding the missing buffer object (BO) locking in the `show_meminfo()` function. Inspecting the BO state without this lock led to a NULL pointer dereference (NPD) or use-after-free (UAF) issues due to concurrent state changes."
