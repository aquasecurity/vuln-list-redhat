    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nocfs2: fix NULL pointer dereference in ocfs2_abort_trigger()\nbdev-\u003ebd_super has been removed and commit 8887b94d9322 change the usage\nfrom bdev-\u003ebd_super to b_assoc_map-\u003ehost-\u003ei_sb.  Since ocfs2 hasn't set\nbh-\u003eb_assoc_map, it will trigger NULL pointer dereference when calling\ninto ocfs2_abort_trigger().\nActually this was pointed out in history, see commit 74e364ad1b13.  But\nI've made a mistake when reviewing commit 8887b94d9322 and then\nre-introduce this regression.\nSince we cannot revive bdev in buffer head, so fix this issue by\ninitializing all types of ocfs2 triggers when fill super, and then get the\nspecific ocfs2 trigger from ocfs2_caching_info when access journal.\n[joseph.qi@linux.alibaba.com: v2]",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The resolved OCFS2 vulnerability involved a NULL pointer dereference in `ocfs2_abort_trigger()`. The issue arose after `dev -\u003ebd_super` was removed and replaced by `b_assoc_map-\u003ehost-\u003ei_sb`, leading to errors since OCFS2 did not set `bh-\u003eb_assoc_map.`"
