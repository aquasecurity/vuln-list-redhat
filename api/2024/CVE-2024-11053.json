  "details": [
    "When asked to both use a `.netrc` file for credentials and to follow HTTP\nredirects, curl could leak the password used for the first host to the\nfollowed-to host under certain circumstances.\nThis flaw only manifests itself if the netrc file has an entry that matches\nthe redirect target hostname but the entry either omits just the password or\nomits both login and password.",
    "A vulnerability was found in libcurl. When .netrc is used to follow with HTTP redirects, curl could leak the password used for the first host to the followed-to host under some circumstances. For example: A curl transfer with `a.com` that redirects to `b.com` that uses a `.netrc` with a match but no password specified for the second host would make curl pass on `alicespassword` as the password even in the second transfer to the separate host `b.com`."
