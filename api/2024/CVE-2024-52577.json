  "statement": "No Red Hat products are affected by this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability marked as Important severity rather than Critical because, while it allows remote code execution (RCE), it requires specific conditions to be met for successful exploitation. An attacker must craft a malicious Ignite message containing a deserializable object that is already present in the serverâ€™s classpath, which limits the attack surface compared to unauthenticated arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities. \nAdditionally, exploitation is constrained to environments where untrusted users have network access to vulnerable Ignite endpoints.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-52577",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In Apache Ignite versions from 2.6.0 and before 2.17.0, configured Class Serialization Filters are ignored for some Ignite endpoints. The vulnerability could be exploited if an attacker manually crafts an Ignite message containing a vulnerable object whose class is present in the Ignite server classpath and sends it to Ignite server endpoints. Deserialization of such a message by the Ignite server may result in the execution of arbitrary code on the Apache Ignite server side.",
    "A flaw was found in Apache Ignite. This vulnerability allows remote code execution via specially crafted Ignite messages that bypass Class Serialization Filters."
