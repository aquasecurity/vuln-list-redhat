Without this detail, the technical risk from this type of denial of service would have been rated Moderate.\nThis issue can only be triggered when zero-copy forwarding of data is enabled. See the mitigation section to see how this mechanism can be disabled.\nThe HAProxy package as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, 8, 9, in Red Hat Ceph Storage 5 and in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 and 4 is not affected by this vulnerability because these products do not ship a vulnerable version of HAProxy.",
