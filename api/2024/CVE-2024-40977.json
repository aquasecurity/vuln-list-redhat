  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nwifi: mt76: mt7921s: fix potential hung tasks during chip recovery\nDuring chip recovery (e.g. chip reset), there is a possible situation that\nkernel worker reset_work is holding the lock and waiting for kernel thread\nstat_worker to be parked, while stat_worker is waiting for the release of\nthe same lock.\nIt causes a deadlock resulting in the dumping of hung tasks messages and\npossible rebooting of the device.\nThis patch prevents the execution of stat_worker during the chip recovery.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's mt76 driver for the mt7921s chip, where a potential deadlock could occur during chip recovery. This situation arises when the kernel worker reset_work holds a lock while waiting for the stat_worker thread, which is simultaneously waiting for the same lock to be released, which leads to hung tasks and may even result in device reboots."
