  "name": "CVE-2024-53920",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In elisp-mode.el in GNU Emacs through 30.0.92, a user who chooses to invoke elisp-completion-at-point (for code completion) on untrusted Emacs Lisp source code can trigger unsafe Lisp macro expansion that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code. (This unsafe expansion also occurs if a user chooses to enable on-the-fly diagnosis that byte compiles untrusted Emacs Lisp source code.)",
    "A flaw was found in Emacs. Viewing or editing an untrusted Emacs Lisp source code file can cause arbitrary code execution due to unsafe macro expansion when a user has configured elisp-completion-at-point for code completion or has enabled automatic error checking, such as Flymake or Flycheck."
