  "statement": "This CVE marked as important vulnerability because it allows a malicious or compromised USB device to trigger out-of-bounds memory accesses in the Linux kernelâ€™s ALSA USB audio subsystem. This occurs due to improper handling of bNumConfigurations, which can lead to memory corruption or even privilege escalation if exploited. Since USB devices can be dynamically plugged in, an attacker with physical access could potentially exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code in kernel space or cause a system crash.\nBecause the kernel supports virtual USB devices, our analysis indicates that this vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who does not have physical access but is able to create virtual USB devices which masquerade as the devices whose drivers are vulnerable.",
  "acknowledgement": "",
  "name": "CVE-2024-53197",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential out-of-bound accesses for Extigy and Mbox devices\nA bogus device can provide a bNumConfigurations value that exceeds the\ninitial value used in usb_get_configuration for allocating dev-\u003econfig.\nThis can lead to out-of-bounds accesses later, e.g. in\nusb_destroy_configuration.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's USB Audio driver. This flaw allows an attacker with physical access to the system to use a malicious USB device to gain additional access. This is possible by manipulating system memory, potentially escalating privileges, or executing arbitrary code."
