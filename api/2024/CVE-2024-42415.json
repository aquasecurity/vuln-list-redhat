  "statement": "This vulnerability is classified as important severity rather than moderate due to its potential for arbitrary code execution, which poses a serious security risk. The integer overflow in the sector allocation table leads to a heap-based buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to write beyond the allocated memory bounds. Exploiting this flaw can result in memory corruption, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected application. Given that the vulnerability can be triggered by merely opening a specially crafted file, this expands the attack surface significantly, making exploitation feasible even through routine user actions like opening documents.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-42415",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the Compound Document Binary File format parser of v1.14.52 of the GNOME Project G Structured File Library (libgsf). A specially crafted file can result in an integer overflow that allows for a heap-based buffer overflow when processing the sector allocation table. This can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.",
