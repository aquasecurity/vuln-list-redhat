  "statement": "This issue is classified as moderate rather than important due to the requirement of authenticated access and specific permissions. While it allows exploitation of loader macros to access unintended fields in Foreman's database, the vulnerability is only accessible to users with permission to view or create templates containing these macros. As a result, the exploit's potential impact is limited to users who already possess a significant level of access within the system. Furthermore, the issue does not lead to privilege escalation, code execution, or direct system compromise, but rather unauthorized data access.",
