  "statement": "The discovered flaw in the OpenShift console's /API/helm/verify endpoint represents a important security vulnerability due to its improper access control mechanism. Specifically, the authHandlerWithUser() middleware function, which is intended to gate access based on user authentication, fails to validate user credentials. This oversight allows unauthenticated users to invoke the endpoint, potentially leading to unauthorized installations or verifications of Helm charts. The ability to perform such actions without authentication undermines the integrity and security of the system, potentially exposing the environment to malicious activities such as unauthorized deployments, data breaches, or service disruptions.",

  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in the Openshift console. The /API/helm/verify endpoint is tasked to fetch and verify the installation of a Helm chart from a URI that is remote HTTP/HTTPS or local. Access to this endpoint is gated by the authHandlerWithUser() middleware function. Contrary to its name, this middleware function does not verify the validity of the user's credentials. As a result, unauthenticated users can access this endpoint.",
