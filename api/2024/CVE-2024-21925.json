  "statement": "This issue occurs due to the lack of sufficient input buffer(s) validation within the AmdPspP2CmboxV2 UEFI module.\nRed Hat has very limited to no visibility and control over binary blobs provided by third-party vendors. Red Hat relies heavily on the vendors to provide timely updates and information about included changes for this content and in most cases merely acts as a release vehicle between the third-party vendor and Red Hat customers with no possibility of influencing or even documenting the changes.\nUnless explicitly stated, the level of insight, oversight, and control Red Hat has does not meet the criteria required (in terms of Red Hat ownership of development processes, QA, and documentation) for releasing this content as RHSA. For more information, please contact the binary content vendor.",
