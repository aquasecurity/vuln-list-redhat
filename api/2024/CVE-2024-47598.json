  "details": [
    "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read vulnerability has been discovered in the qtdemux_merge_sample_table function within qtdemux.c. The problem is that the size of the stts buffer isnâ€™t properly checked before reading stts_duration, allowing the program to read 4 bytes beyond the boundaries of stts-\u003edata. This vulnerability reads up to 4 bytes past the allocated bounds of the stts array. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
    "A flaw was found in the GStreamer library. When handling raw audio tracks, out-of-bounds reads in the MP4/MOV demuxer's sample table parser can cause crashes for certain input files, potentially allowing a malicious actor to trigger an application crash."
