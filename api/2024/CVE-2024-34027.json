  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nf2fs: compress: fix to cover {reserve,release}_compress_blocks() w/ cp_rwsem lock\nIt needs to cover {reserve,release}_compress_blocks() w/ cp_rwsem lock\nto avoid racing with checkpoint, otherwise, filesystem metadata including\nblkaddr in dnode, inode fields and .total_valid_block_count may be\ncorrupted after SPO case.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Flash-Friendly File System (F2FS) in the Linux kernel, where the reserve_compress_blocks() and release_compress_blocks() functions were not adequately protected by the cp_rwsem lock. This locking deficiency could lead to race conditions, potentially causing data corruption or system instability when multiple processes access these functions concurrently. The issue has been addressed in a kernel update to ensure proper locking and prevent such race conditions."
