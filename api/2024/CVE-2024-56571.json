  "details": [
    "[REJECTED CVE] A vulnerability was identified in the Linux kernel's uvcvideo driver, where media entities could be allocated with an ID of 0 or duplicate IDs, violating the UVC 1.1+ specification. This flaw allowed malformed USB video device descriptors to create invalid media entity chains, potentially causing kernel warnings and crashes due to entities referencing themselves or forming backward loops. An attacker with physical or emulated USB device access could exploit this by crafting a malicious UVC device that triggers kernel warnings or system instability."
