  "statement": "CVE-2024-26601 is considered a Moderate severity issue because its impact is limited to specific conditions during the fast commit replay process of the ext4 filesystem. The vulnerability involves the marking of already free blocks as free, which leads to buddy bitmap corruption. However, this scenario is relatively rare and typically occurs only under certain workload patterns. Additionally, the corruption affects internal filesystem metadata rather than user data directly, reducing the immediate risk of data loss or system compromise. The issue can be mitigated by regenerating the buddy bitmap, and standard filesystem integrity checks and recovery procedures can often address any inconsistencies that arise.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\next4: regenerate buddy after block freeing failed if under fc replay\nThis mostly reverts commit 6bd97bf273bd (\"ext4: remove redundant\nmb_regenerate_buddy()\") and reintroduces mb_regenerate_buddy(). Based on\ncode in mb_free_blocks(), fast commit replay can end up marking as free\nblocks that are already marked as such. This causes corruption of the\nbuddy bitmap so we need to regenerate it in that case.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem related to the fast commit replay process. During this process, blocks that are already marked as free can be incorrectly marked as free again, leading to the corruption of the buddy bitmap, which is used to track free and allocated blocks. This corruption can result in filesystem inconsistencies and potential data loss. The issue is resolved by reintroducing the mb_regenerate_buddy() function, which regenerates the buddy bitmap to ensure its integrity."
