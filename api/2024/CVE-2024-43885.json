  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nbtrfs: fix double inode unlock for direct IO sync writes\nIf we do a direct IO sync write, at btrfs_sync_file(), and we need to skip\ninode logging or we get an error starting a transaction or an error when\nflushing delalloc, we end up unlocking the inode when we shouldn't under\nthe 'out_release_extents' label, and then unlock it again at\nbtrfs_direct_write().\nFix that by checking if we have to skip inode unlocking under that label.",
    "A flaw in the Linux kernelâ€™s btrfs filesystem was identified during direct I/O synchronous writes where the inode could be incorrectly unlocked twice. This issue arose in the btrfs_sync_file() function when certain conditions, such as skipping inode logging or encountering errors while starting a transaction or flushing delayed allocations, led to premature inode unlocking at the out_release_extents label."
