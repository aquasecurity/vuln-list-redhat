  "statement": "This vulnerability in cURL's utf8asn1str() function is classified as a moderate severity issue rather than an important one due to its specific exploitability conditions and impact. While the flaw allows a remote attacker to induce a denial of service by triggering a memory allocation flaw, the outcome is generally a crash rather than more severe consequences. Modern memory management implementations typically detect and abort such improper free() operations, mitigating the risk of arbitrary code execution or extensive memory corruption. Additionally, the requirement of a specially crafted TLS certificate to exploit this vulnerability further limits its likelihood of widespread exploitation, thereby reducing the overall severity.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-6197",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "libcurl's ASN1 parser has this utf8asn1str() function used for parsing an ASN.1 UTF-8 string. Itcan detect an invalid field and return error. Unfortunately, when doing so it also invokes `free()` on a 4 byte localstack buffer.  Most modern malloc implementations detect this error and immediately abort. Some however accept the input pointer and add that memory to its list of available chunks. This leads to the overwriting of nearby stack memory. The content of the overwrite is decided by the `free()` implementation; likely to be memory pointers and a set of flags.  The most likely outcome of exploting this flaw is a crash, although it cannot be ruled out that more serious results can be had in special circumstances.",
