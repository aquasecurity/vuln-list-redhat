  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "[REJECTED CVE] A vulnerability in the Linux kernel's memory management subsystem caused a regression that unintentionally prevented memfd mappings sealed with F_SEAL_WRITE from being mapped as read-only. This was due to an incorrect placement of the mapping_map_writable() check before invoking shmem_mmap(), effectively undoing previous logic that allowed such mappings. An attacker could exploit this by restricting legitimate read-only mappings, potentially causing denial-of-service conditions for applications relying on memfd protections."
