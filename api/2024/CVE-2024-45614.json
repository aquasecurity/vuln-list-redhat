  "statement": "This issue is classified as moderate severity rather than important because, while it allows clients to manipulate proxy-set headers like `X-Forwarded-For`, its exploitability depends on specific conditions. The vulnerability only affects applications that rely on these headers for security purposes, such as IP-based access controls or logging, and is mitigated by proper server configurations (e.g., using `underscores_in_headers off` in Nginx). Furthermore, it does not directly compromise the server's integrity or enable arbitrary code execution.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-45614",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Puma is a Ruby/Rack web server built for parallelism. In affected versions clients could clobber values set by intermediate proxies (such as X-Forwarded-For) by providing a underscore version of the same header (X-Forwarded_For). Any users relying on proxy set variables is affected. v6.4.3/v5.6.9 now discards any headers using underscores if the non-underscore version also exists. Effectively, allowing the proxy defined headers to always win. Users are advised to upgrade. Nginx has a underscores_in_headers configuration variable to discard these headers at the proxy level as a mitigation. Any users that are implicitly trusting the proxy defined headers for security should immediately cease doing so until upgraded to the fixed versions.",
