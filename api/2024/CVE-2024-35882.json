    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nSUNRPC: Fix a slow server-side memory leak with RPC-over-TCP\nJan Schunk reports that his small NFS servers suffer from memory\nexhaustion after just a few days. A bisect shows that commit\ne18e157bb5c8 (\"SUNRPC: Send RPC message on TCP with a single\nsock_sendmsg() call\") is the first bad commit.\nThat commit assumed that sock_sendmsg() releases all the pages in\nthe underlying bio_vec array, but the reality is that it doesn't.\nsvc_xprt_release() releases the rqst's response pages, but the\nrecord marker page fragment isn't one of those, so it is never\nreleased.\nThis is a narrow fix that can be applied to stable kernels. A\nmore extensive fix is in the works.",
    "A memory leak vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's SUNRPC implementation for RPC-over-TCP. The issue occurs because the `sock_sendmsg()` function does not release all memory pages in the underlying `bio_vec` array, causing a slow memory leak that affects servers using NFS and can lead to memory exhaustion over time."
