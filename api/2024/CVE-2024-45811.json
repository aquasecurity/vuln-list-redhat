  "statement": "This vulnerability is classified as moderate rather than high severity because it requires specific conditions for exploitation. The attacker must have access to the Vite server, which typically runs in a local development environment rather than in production. Additionally, the bypass allows file access only if the file path is already known or predictable, limiting the attacker's ability to arbitrarily explore the file system. While it exposes file content outside the Vite serving allow list, the scope of access is constrained, and the impact can be mitigated by proper server configurations and deployment practices.",

  "details": [
    "Vite a frontend build tooling framework for javascript. In affected versions the contents of arbitrary files can be returned to the browser. `@fs` denies access to files outside of Vite serving allow list. Adding `?import\u0026raw` to the URL bypasses this limitation and returns the file content if it exists. This issue has been patched in versions 5.4.6, 5.3.6, 5.2.14, 4.5.5, and 3.2.11. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
