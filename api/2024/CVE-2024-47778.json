  "details": [
    "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read vulnerability has been discovered in gst_wavparse_adtl_chunk within gstwavparse.c. This vulnerability arises due to insufficient validation of the size parameter, which can exceed the bounds of the data buffer. As a result, an OOB read occurs in the following while loop. This vulnerability can result in reading up to 4GB of process memory or potentially causing a segmentation fault (SEGV) when accessing invalid memory. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
    "A flaw was found in the GStreamer library. Various out-of-bounds reads in the WAV parser can cause crashes for certain input files, potentially allowing a malicious actor to trigger an application crash."
