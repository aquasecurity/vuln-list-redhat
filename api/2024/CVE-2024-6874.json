  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "libcurl's URL API function\n[curl_url_get()](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_url_get.html) offers punycode\nconversions, to and from IDN. Asking to convert a name that is exactly 256\nbytes, libcurl ends up reading outside of a stack based buffer when built to\nuse the *macidn* IDN backend. The conversion function then fills up the\nprovided buffer exactly - but does not null terminate the string.\nThis flaw can lead to stack contents accidently getting returned as part of\nthe converted string.",
    "A buffer overread vulnerability was found in Curl's URL API function curl_url_get(). This issue allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information due to a punycode buffer overread flaw. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker can gain sensitive information and potentially launch further attacks against the affected system."
