  "statement": "The heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the Assimp library is classified as moderate because, while it can cause memory corruption or application crashes, it does not inherently lead to arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation. Exploitation requires a crafted OpenGEX file, limiting the attack surface to scenarios where untrusted files are processed by the affected function.\nIt's important to note that this vulnerability does not impact any Red Hat products, indicating that Red Hat's software stack is unaffected by this specific CVE.",

  "details": [
    "A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability has been identified in the OpenDDLParser::parseStructure function within the Assimp library, specifically during the processing of OpenGEX files.",
    "A flaw was found in the Assimp asset import library. An attacker my be able to trigger a buffer overflow condition via specially-crafted OpenGEX files. This may lead to a denial of service or other unexpected behavior."
