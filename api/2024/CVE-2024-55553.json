  "details": [
    "In FRRouting (FRR) before 10.3, it is possible for an attacker to trigger repeated RIB revalidation by sending approximately 500 RPKI updates, potentially leading to prolonged revalidation times and a Denial of Service (DoS) scenario.",
    "A security issue was discovered in FRRouting (FRR). It is possible for an attacker to send excessive Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) updates, triggering FRR to re-validate all routes in the routing information base each time. This can cause high CPU and network bandwidth consumption, potentially leading to a denial of service."
