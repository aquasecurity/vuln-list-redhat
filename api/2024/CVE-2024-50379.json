  "statement": "This flaw can only be exploited when the `readonly` initialization parameter value is set to `false`, when running on case insensitive file systems and when the application is under load, specifically when read and upload operations are performed on the same file simultaneously.\nThe default `readonly` initialization parameter value is `true` and not vulnerable to this issue.\nDue to the conditions for this issue to be exploited, especially because it requires unlikely configurations, this flaw has been rated with a Moderate severity.\nThe Tomcat package as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 is not affected by this vulnerability because the vulnerable code was introduced in a newer Tomcat version.\nRed Hat Satellite is not directed impacted by this issue as it does not include the affected Tomcat package. However, Tomcat is consumed by Candlepin, a component of Satellite. Red Hat Satellite users are advised to check the impact state of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as any necessary fixes will be distributed through the platform.",

    "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability during JSP compilation in Apache Tomcat permits an RCE on case insensitive file systems when the default servlet is enabled for write (non-default configuration).\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.1, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.33, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.97.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.2, 10.1.34 or 9.0.98, which fixes the issue.",
    "A flaw was found in Tomcat. A Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition occurs during JSP compilation on case-insensitive file systems when the default servlet is enabled for writing. This vulnerability allows an uploaded file to be treated as a JSP and executed, resulting in remote code execution."
