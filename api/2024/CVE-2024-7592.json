  "statement": "This vulnerability is classified as low severity, as also marked by upstream Python, because while it can cause excessive CPU usage, its exploitability is constrained by practical factors. Most production environments enforce request size limits (e.g., via web servers like Nginx or Apache), preventing attackers from sending arbitrarily large cookies. \nAdditionally, the impact is localized to individual requests, meaning it does not persistently degrade system performance or lead to remote code execution (RCE). The attack requires multiple large requests to have a significant effect, making it inefficient compared to more severe denial-of-service (DoS) vectors.",

  "details": [
    "There is a LOW severity vulnerability affecting CPython, specifically the\n'http.cookies' standard library module.\nWhen parsing cookies that contained backslashes for quoted characters in\nthe cookie value, the parser would use an algorithm with quadratic\ncomplexity, resulting in excess CPU resources being used while parsing the\nvalue.",
    "A flaw was found in the `http.cookies` module in the Python package. When parsing cookies that contain backslashes, under certain circumstances, the module uses an algorithm with quadratic complexity, leading to excessive CPU consumption."
