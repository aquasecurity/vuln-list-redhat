  "statement": "Due to certain circumstances, this vulnerability in the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is not affecting Red Hat Products and is rated as Important severity rather than Critical. First, a specifically crafted container image is required for effective exploitation. Only Red Hat Signed containers are offered. Additionally, user interaction is required for exploitation, further reducing the likelihood of an attack. Most importantly, this vulnerability does not impact use cases that comply with our operating procedures by utilizing the Container Device Interface (CDI). As a result, this vulnerability does not affect Red Hat products because of the use of CDI. Furthermore, for an attacker to deploy a crafted container image, they would need an environment that permits untrusted containers, which is a scenario that is not typical for Red Hat customers.",

  "details": [
    "NVIDIA Container Toolkit 1.16.1 or earlier contains a Time-of-check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability when used with default configuration where a specifically crafted container image may gain access to the host file system. This does not impact use cases where CDI is used. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering.",
