  "statement": "The discovered flaw in the BIND9 package is of high severity due to its dual impact on DNS server functionality and stability. The issue where client queries trigger the return of stale data undermines the integrity and reliability of DNS responses, potentially leading to incorrect or outdated information being served to clients. This can cause significant disruptions in services reliant on accurate DNS resolutions. Moreover, the assertion failure triggered by local lookups poses a critical threat, as it can crash the BIND server, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). Such an outage disrupts DNS operations, impacting network availability and access to internet services.",
