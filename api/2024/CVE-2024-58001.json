    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nocfs2: handle a symlink read error correctly\nPatch series \"Convert ocfs2 to use folios\".\nMark did a conversion of ocfs2 to use folios and sent it to me as a\ngiant patch for review ;-)\nSo I've redone it as individual patches, and credited Mark for the patches\nwhere his code is substantially the same.  It's not a bad way to do it;\nhis patch had some bugs and my patches had some bugs.  Hopefully all our\nbugs were different from each other.  And hopefully Mark likes all the\nchanges I made to his code!\nThis patch (of 23):\nIf we can't read the buffer, be sure to unlock the page before returning."
