  "details": [
    "Clients using DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) can exhaust a DNS resolver's CPU and/or memory by flooding it with crafted valid or invalid HTTP/2 traffic.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.18.0 through 9.18.32, 9.20.0 through 9.20.4, 9.21.0 through 9.21.3, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.32-S1.",
    "A flaw was found in BIND 9. By flooding a target resolver with HTTP/2 traffic and exploiting this flaw, an attacker could overwhelm the server, causing high CPU and/or memory usage and preventing other clients from establishing DoH connections. This issue could significantly impair the resolver's performance and effectively deny legitimate clients access to the DNS resolution service."
