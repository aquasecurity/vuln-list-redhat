  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnet: txgbe: initialize num_q_vectors for MSI/INTx interrupts\nWhen using MSI/INTx interrupts, wx-\u003enum_q_vectors is uninitialized.\nThus there will be kernel panic in wx_alloc_q_vectors() to allocate\nqueue vectors.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's `txgbe` driver involving uninitialized `num_q_vectors` when using MSI/INTx interrupts. This can lead to kernel panics during the allocation of queue vectors due to the use of undefined values. This issue was resolved by ensuring `num_q_vectors` is properly initialized, thereby preventing system crashes and enhancing overall stability."
