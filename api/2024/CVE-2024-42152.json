  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnvmet: fix a possible leak when destroy a ctrl during qp establishment\nIn nvmet_sq_destroy we capture sq-\u003ectrl early and if it is non-NULL we\nknow that a ctrl was allocated (in the admin connect request handler)\nand we need to release pending AERs, clear ctrl-\u003esqs and sq-\u003ectrl\n(for nvme-loop primarily), and drop the final reference on the ctrl.\nHowever, a small window is possible where nvmet_sq_destroy starts (as\na result of the client giving up and disconnecting) concurrently with\nthe nvme admin connect cmd (which may be in an early stage). But *before*\nkill_and_confirm of sq-\u003eref (i.e. the admin connect managed to get an sq\nlive reference). In this case, sq-\u003ectrl was allocated however after it was\ncaptured in a local variable in nvmet_sq_destroy.\nThis prevented the final reference drop on the ctrl.\nSolve this by re-capturing the sq-\u003ectrl after all inflight request has\ncompleted, where for sure sq-\u003ectrl reference is final, and move forward\nbased on that.\nThis issue was observed in an environment with many hosts connecting\nmultiple ctrls simoutanuosly, creating a delay in allocating a ctrl\nleading up to this race window."
