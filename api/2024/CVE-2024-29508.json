  "statement": "The vulnerability in Ghostscriptâ€™s pdf_base_font_alloc function represents a moderate severity issue rather than a important one due to the nature of the exposed information. While the hexadecimal pointer representation of the BaseFont name can be read from the output file, it does not directly reveal sensitive data such as user credentials or confidential content. Instead, the pointer value may offer insights into the memory layout or internal data structures, which, although potentially useful for further exploitation, requires additional steps and context to leverage effectively.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-29508",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Artifex Ghostscript before 10.03.0 has a heap-based pointer disclosure (observable in a constructed BaseFont name) in the function pdf_base_font_alloc.",
    "A flaw was found in Ghostscript. The`pdf_base_font_alloc` function used by the `pdfwrite` device will use a hexadecimal pointer representation for the constructed BaseFont name if the input name is empty. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain this pointer value by reading back to the output file after writing to a temporary writable and readable location."
