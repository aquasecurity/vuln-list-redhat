  "statement": "This CVE affects libxml2 versions 2.11 before 2.11.9, 2.12 before 2.12.9, and 2.13 before 2.13.3.\nThis vulnerability is marked as critical severity instead of important due to its potential to completely compromise system security. By exploiting the XXE vulnerability, an attacker can achieve arbitrary file disclosure (e.g., reading `/etc/passwd`), which exposes sensitive system information and credentials. \nIn worst-case scenarios, the flaw can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in misconfigured environments or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) through resource exhaustion. The issue is especially critical because it stems from a broken protection mechanism (due to the renaming of the \"checked\" member), silently leaving downstream applications vulnerable without their knowledge.",

  "details": [
    "In libxml2 2.11 before 2.11.9, 2.12 before 2.12.9, and 2.13 before 2.13.3, the SAX parser can produce events for external entities even if custom SAX handlers try to override entity content (by setting \"checked\"). This makes classic XXE attacks possible."
