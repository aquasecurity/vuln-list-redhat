    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ndrm/amd/display: fix NULL checks for adev-\u003edm.dc in amdgpu_dm_fini()\nSince 'adev-\u003edm.dc' in amdgpu_dm_fini() might turn out to be NULL\nbefore the call to dc_enable_dmub_notifications(), check\nbeforehand to ensure there will not be a possible NULL-ptr-deref\nthere.\nAlso, since commit 1e88eb1b2c25 (\"drm/amd/display: Drop\nCONFIG_DRM_AMD_DC_HDCP\") there are two separate checks for NULL in\n'adev-\u003edm.dc' before dc_deinit_callbacks() and dc_dmub_srv_destroy().\nClean up by combining them all under one 'if'.\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static\nanalysis tool SVACE.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's AMD amdgpu_dm.c driver, where a lack of proper checks in the amdgpu_dm_fini() function could result in a NULL pointer dereference. This scenario can occur when attempting to access the value adev-\u003edm.dc and could lead to memory corruption or system instability."
