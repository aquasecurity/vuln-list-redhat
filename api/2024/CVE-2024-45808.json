  "statement": "The vulnerability in Envoy that allows attackers to inject unexpected content into access logs is classified as moderate severity rather than important because the impact is primarily related to log integrity rather than direct exploitation of the system or data breaches, which lowers the overall risk profile. While log tampering can lead to misleading information, it does not directly compromise the applicationâ€™s functionality or security boundaries. Additionally, the attack requires specific conditions to succeed, relying on the lack of validation for the `REQUESTED_SERVER_NAME` field, which may not be present in all configurations.",

  "details": [
    "Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. A vulnerability has been identified in Envoy that allows malicious attackers to inject unexpected content into access logs. This is achieved by exploiting the lack of validation for the `REQUESTED_SERVER_NAME` field for access loggers. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.31.2, 1.30.6, 1.29.9, and 1.28.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
