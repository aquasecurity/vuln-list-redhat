  "statement": "Red Hat rates this flaw to have moderate severity as it depends on specific configurations for the attack to succeed, symbolic link syncing must be  enabled (explicitly by providing the `--links` option or implicitly such as with `--archive`) and the client must connect to a malicious or compromised server.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A path traversal vulnerability exists in rsync. It stems from behavior enabled by the `--inc-recursive` option, a default-enabled option for many client options and can be enabled by the server even if not explicitly enabled by the client. When using the `--inc-recursive` option, a lack of proper symlink verification coupled with deduplication checks occurring on a per-file-list basis could allow a server to write files outside of the client's intended destination directory. A malicious server could write malicious files to arbitrary locations named after valid directories/paths on the client.",
