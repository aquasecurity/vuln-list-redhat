    "Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch, version 3.3.0.beta3 on the `beta` branch, and version 3.3.0.beta4-dev on the `tests-passed` branch, a rogue staff user could suspend other staff users preventing them from logging in to the site. The issue is patched in version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch, version 3.3.0.beta3 on the `beta` branch, and version 3.3.0.beta4-dev on the `tests-passed` branch. No known workarounds are available."
