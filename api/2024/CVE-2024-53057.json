    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnet/sched: stop qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog on TC_H_ROOT\nIn qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog, Qdiscs with major handle ffff: are assumed\nto be either root or ingress. This assumption is bogus since it's valid\nto create egress qdiscs with major handle ffff:\nBudimir Markovic found that for qdiscs like DRR that maintain an active\nclass list, it will cause a UAF with a dangling class pointer.\nIn 066a3b5b2346, the concern was to avoid iterating over the ingress\nqdisc since its parent is itself. The proper fix is to stop when parent\nTC_H_ROOT is reached because the only way to retrieve ingress is when a\nhierarchy which does not contain a ffff: major handle call into\nqdisc_lookup with TC_H_MAJ(TC_H_ROOT).\nIn the scenario where major ffff: is an egress qdisc in any of the tree\nlevels, the updates will also propagate to TC_H_ROOT, which then the\niteration must stop.\nnet/sched/sch_api.c | 2 +-\n1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)",
    "A flaw was found in the packet scheduler API in the Linux kernel. An invalid assumption about qdiscs with major handle ffff allows qdiscs, such as DRR, that maintain an active class list to cause a use-after-free with a dangling class pointer."
