  "details": [
    "Socket.IO is an open source, real-time, bidirectional, event-based, communication framework. A specially crafted Socket.IO packet can trigger an uncaught exception on the Socket.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process. This issue is fixed by commit `15af22fc22` which has been included in `socket.io@4.6.2` (released in May 2023). The fix was backported in the 2.x branch as well with commit `d30630ba10`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may attach a listener for the \"error\" event to catch these errors.",
    "A vulnerability was found in Socket.IO where a specially crafted packet can trigger an uncaught exception on the server, causing the Node.js process to crash. When the server receives this malformed packet, it results in an unhandled error event that stops the Socket.IO server from functioning correctly. This issue arises because the server fails to manage unexpected errors properly, leading to a disruption in service."
