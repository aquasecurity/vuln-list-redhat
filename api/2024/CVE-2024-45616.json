    "A vulnerability was found in OpenSC, OpenSC tools, PKCS#11 module, minidriver, and CTK. An attacker could use a crafted USB Device or Smart Card, which would present the system with a specially crafted response to APDUs. \nThe following problems were caused by insufficient control of the response APDU buffer and its length when communicating with the card.",
