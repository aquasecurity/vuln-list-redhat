  "statement": "This vulnerability marked as important severity rather than moderate due to its potential to cause a complete denial of service (DoS) by exploiting a segmentation fault through malformed JSON data. The flaw stems from improper input validation, which allows attackers to crash the server by sending invalid data that triggers memory mismanagement. Since iperf is widely used in performance testing of network systems, a DoS attack could disrupt critical operations in production environments, leading to service outages or performance degradation in large-scale networks.",

    "A flaw was found in iperf. This vulnerability allows a Denial of Service (DoS) via the injection of malformed JSON data, which can result in a segmentation fault when a NULL pointer is passed to strdup()."
