    "Qualys discovered that if unsanitized input was used with the library Modules::ScanDeps, before version 1.36 a local attacker could possibly execute arbitrary shell commands by open()ing a \"pesky pipe\" (such as passing \"commands|\" as a filename) or by passing arbitrary strings to eval().",
    "A flaw was found in the Module-ScanDeps package. Due to the handling of unsanitized input, a local attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands or potentially escalate privileges on the host."
