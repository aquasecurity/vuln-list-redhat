  "statement": "The severity of CVE-2024-6655 is considered moderate rather than important because it requires specific conditions to be exploited effectively. The vulnerability relies on the presence of a missing GTK module and requires the attacker to place a malicious library in the same directory as the vulnerable application. Furthermore, exploitation typically requires user interaction, such as running the application from a directory containing potentially malicious files. Unlike higher-severity issues, this vulnerability does not grant immediate remote code execution without user assistance, limiting its overall impact and likelihood of widespread exploitation.",
