  "details": [
    "Vim is an open source command line text editor. double-free in dialog_changed() in Vim \u003c v9.1.0648. When abandoning a buffer, Vim may ask the user what to do with the modified buffer. If the user wants the changed buffer to be saved, Vim may create a new Untitled file, if the buffer did not have a name yet. However, when setting the buffer name to Unnamed, Vim will falsely free a pointer twice, leading to a double-free and possibly later to a heap-use-after-free, which can lead to a crash. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0648.",
    "A vulnerability was found in Vim versions before 9.1.0648 that can cause the program to crash. This issue happens when a user abandons a modified file, and Vim tries to save it as an Untitled file. Due to a mistake in handling this process, Vim accidentally tries to free up memory twice, which can lead to problems, causing the program to crash. This issue can be exploited by someone with local access to the system."
