  "statement": "The HashDoS vulnerability in OpenResty’s `lj_str_hash.c` file, while impactful, is classified as a moderate severity issue rather than critical. This classification is due to the nature of the attack vector, which requires crafted input to exploit the hashing function and induce excessive resource usage. The exploitability of this vulnerability depends on the attacker’s ability to generate and send specifically designed requests, which may limit its practical impact compared to vulnerabilities that allow for more straightforward or widespread attacks. Additionally, the effect is confined to resource exhaustion, which, although disruptive, does not directly lead to unauthorized data access or system compromise.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-39702",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In lj_str_hash.c in OpenResty 1.19.3.1 through 1.25.3.1, the string hashing function (used during string interning) allows HashDoS (Hash Denial of Service) attacks. An attacker could cause excessive resource usage during proxy operations via crafted requests, potentially leading to a denial of service with relatively few incoming requests. This vulnerability only exists in the OpenResty fork in the openresty/luajit2 GitHub repository. The LuaJIT/LuaJIT repository. is unaffected.",
    "A flaw was found in the OpenResty package. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) through the string hashing function. This flaw allows an attacker to cause excessive resource usage and potentially lead to a denial of service with relatively few incoming requests."
