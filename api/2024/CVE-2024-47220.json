  "statement": "This CVE is rated as having Moderate impact because Webrick should not be used in production.

  "name": "CVE-2024-47220",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in the WEBrick toolkit through 1.8.1 for Ruby. It allows HTTP request smuggling by providing both a Content-Length header and a Transfer-Encoding header, e.g., \"GET /admin HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\" inside of a \"POST /user HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\" request. NOTE: the supplier's position is \"Webrick should not be used in production.\"",
    "A flaw was found in the webrick toolkit. This issue occurs because the server incorrectly handles requests with both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers. This can allow an attacker to sneak in an extra request such as GET /admin after the normal request POST /user. As a result, unauthorized users can access restricted areas like /admin by POST /user."
