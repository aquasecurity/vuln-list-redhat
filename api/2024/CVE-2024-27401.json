    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nfirewire: nosy: ensure user_length is taken into account when fetching packet contents\nEnsure that packet_buffer_get respects the user_length provided. If\nthe length of the head packet exceeds the user_length, packet_buffer_get\nwill now return 0 to signify to the user that no data were read\nand a larger buffer size is required. Helps prevent user space overflows.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's FireWire subsystem, which involves inadequate handling of the `user_length` parameter when fetching packet contents. This issue could potentially lead to security issues, such as unauthorized access or manipulation of memory."
