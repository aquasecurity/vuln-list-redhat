    "REXML is an XML toolkit for Ruby. The REXML gem 3.3.2 has a DoS vulnerability when it parses an XML that has many entity expansions with SAX2 or pull parser API. The REXML gem 3.3.3 or later include the patch to fix the vulnerability.",
    "A flaw was found in the REXML package. Reading an XML file that contains many entity expansions may lead to a denial of service due to resource starvation. An attacker can use this flaw to trick a user into processing an untrusted XML file."
