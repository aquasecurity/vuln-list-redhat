  "statement": "This issue is classified as moderate severity rather than important because while it allows unauthorized access to certain endpoints, the exposure is limited to non-critical or low-impact data. The endpoints in question, such as `/api/console/version` and `/api/plugins/`, do not provide access to highly sensitive information or critical system functionality that could directly compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of the system. Additionally, since authentication is still handled by the service, the risk of widespread unauthorized access is mitigated.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-7128",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in the OpenShift console. Several endpoints in the application use the authHandler() and authHandlerWithUser() middleware functions. When the default authentication provider (\"openShiftAuth\") is set, these functions do not perform any authentication checks, relying instead on the targeted service to handle authentication and authorization. This issue leads to various degrees of data exposure due to a lack of proper credential verification.",
