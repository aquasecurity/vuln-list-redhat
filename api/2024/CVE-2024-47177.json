  "details": [
    "CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and cups-filters provides backends, filters, and other software for CUPS 2.x to use on non-Mac OS systems. Any value passed to `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` via a PPD file will be executed as a user controlled command. When combined with other logic bugs as described in CVE_2024-47176, this can lead to remote command execution.",
    "A security flaw was found in OpenPrinting CUPS. The `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` directive in a PPD file will allow arbitrary commands to be executed when a print job is sent to the affected printing device. An attacker who could provide a malicious PPD file for a new print device or modify a PPD file of an existing device could execute arbitrary commands."
