  "details": [
    "Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals. When using the AWS S3 or GCS storage provider for TechDocs it is possible to access content in the entire storage bucket. This can leak contents of the bucket that are not intended to be accessible, as well as bypass permission checks in Backstage. This has been fixed in the 1.10.13 release of the `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend` package. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
