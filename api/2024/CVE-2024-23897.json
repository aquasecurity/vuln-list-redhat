  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in Jenkins, which uses the args4j library to parse command arguments and options on the Jenkins controller when processing CLI commands. This command parser has a feature that replaces the \"@\" character followed by a file path in an argument with the file’s contents (expandAtFiles). This feature is enabled by default; Jenkins 2.441 and earlier as well as LTS 2.426.2 and earlier do not disable it."
