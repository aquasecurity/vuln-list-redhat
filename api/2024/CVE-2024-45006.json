The NULL pointer dereference occurs during the re-enumeration process and primarily impacts systems under specific failure scenarios. While it can lead to kernel crashes, the impact is limited to certain USB enumeration situations and does not affect the majority of typical device operations or the overall system stability.",

    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nxhci: Fix Panther point NULL pointer deref at full-speed re-enumeration\nre-enumerating full-speed devices after a failed address device command\ncan trigger a NULL pointer dereference.\nFull-speed devices may need to reconfigure the endpoint 0 Max Packet Size\nvalue during enumeration. Usb core calls usb_ep0_reinit() in this case,\nwhich ends up calling xhci_configure_endpoint().\nOn Panther point xHC the xhci_configure_endpoint() function will\nadditionally check and reserve bandwidth in software. Other hosts do\nthis in hardware\nIf xHC address device command fails then a new xhci_virt_device structure\nis allocated as part of re-enabling the slot, but the bandwidth table\npointers are not set up properly here.\nThis triggers the NULL pointer dereference the next time usb_ep0_reinit()\nis called and xhci_configure_endpoint() tries to check and reserve\nbandwidth\n[46710.713538] usb 3-1: new full-speed USB device number 5 using xhci_hcd\n[46710.713699] usb 3-1: Device not responding to setup address.\n[46710.917684] usb 3-1: Device not responding to setup address.\n[46711.125536] usb 3-1: device not accepting address 5, error -71\n[46711.125594] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008\n[46711.125600] #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n[46711.125603] #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n[46711.125606] PGD 0 P4D 0\n[46711.125610] Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI\n[46711.125615] CPU: 1 PID: 25760 Comm: kworker/1:2 Not tainted 6.10.3_2 #1\n[46711.125620] Hardware name: Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.\n[46711.125623] Workqueue: usb_hub_wq hub_event [usbcore]\n[46711.125668] RIP: 0010:xhci_reserve_bandwidth (drivers/usb/host/xhci.c\nFix this by making sure bandwidth table pointers are set up correctly\nafter a failed address device command, and additionally by avoiding\nchecking for bandwidth in cases like this where no actual endpoints are\nadded or removed, i.e. only context for default control endpoint 0 is\nevaluated.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel, which involves a NULL pointer dereference in the xHCI driver during full-speed USB device enumeration. When a failed address device command occurs, the `xhci_virt_device` structure is allocated, but its bandwidth table pointers are not properly initialized. This issue leads to a NULL pointer dereference the next time `usb_ep0_reinit()` is called."
