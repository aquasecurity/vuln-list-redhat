  "statement": "The buffer overflow vulnerability in Ghostscript, while serious, is categorized as moderate severity due to its limited impact vector and exploitation complexity. The flaw involves unchecked copying of data into a buffer via memcpy when handling the cidfsubstpath and cidfsubstfont parameters. Although this can lead to a stack buffer overflow, resulting in potential denial of service or unexpected behavior, the exploitability is constrained by specific conditions under which the parameters must be set. Furthermore, successful exploitation requires the attacker to have control over the input parameters and the environment in which Ghostscript operates.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-29507",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Artifex Ghostscript before 10.03.0 sometimes has a stack-based buffer overflow via the CIDFSubstPath and CIDFSubstFont parameters.",
    "A flaw was found in Ghostscript. Under specific conditions, the `cidfsubstpath` and `cidfsubstfont` parameters set by corresponding Postscript objects are used to load substitute fonts in `pdfi_open_CIDFont_substitute_file`. The values are copied via `memcpy` into the `fontfname` buffer without bounds checks. This flaw allows an attacker to pass values larger than the buffer size to trigger a stack buffer overflow, leading to a denial of service or other unexpected behavior."
