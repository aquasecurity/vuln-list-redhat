  "statement": "This vulnerability marked as important severity rather than moderate due to the potential for exploitation leading to arbitrary code execution. The integer overflow during memory allocation results in a mismatch between the allocated memory size and the expected number of elements, causing an out-of-bounds write (OOB-write). Such memory corruption can lead to application crashes, data corruption, or, more critically, allow an attacker to write controlled data outside the allocated buffer. This opens the door to heap-based buffer overflows, which are commonly exploited to overwrite control structures or function pointers, enabling attackers to execute malicious code.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-47537",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. The program attempts to reallocate the memory pointed to by stream-\u003esamples to accommodate stream-\u003en_samples + samples_count elements of type QtDemuxSample. The problem is that samples_count is read from the input file. And if this value is big enough, this can lead to an integer overflow during the addition. As a consequence, g_try_renew might allocate memory for a significantly smaller number of elements than intended. Following this, the program iterates through samples_count elements and attempts to write samples_count number of elements, potentially exceeding the actual allocated memory size and causing an OOB-write. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
    "A flaw was found in the GStreamer library. An integer overflow in the MP4/MOV demuxer's sample table parser can lead to out-of-bounds writes and NULL-pointer dereferences for certain input files. This vulnerability allows a malicious third party to trigger an application crash and, in the case of out-of-bounds writes, possibly allow code execution through heap manipulation."
