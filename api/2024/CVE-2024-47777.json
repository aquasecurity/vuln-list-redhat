  "details": [
    "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read vulnerability has been identified in the gst_wavparse_smpl_chunk function within gstwavparse.c. This function attempts to read 4 bytes from the data + 12 offset without checking if the size of the data buffer is sufficient. If the buffer is too small, the function reads beyond its bounds. This vulnerability may result in reading 4 bytes out of the boundaries of the data buffer. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
    "A flaw was found in the GStreamer library. Various out-of-bounds reads in the WAV parser can cause crashes for certain input files, potentially allowing a malicious actor to trigger an application crash."
