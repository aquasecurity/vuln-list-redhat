  "statement": "This vulnerability in the GStreamer RTSP server is classified as moderate rather than important because, while it can cause a denial of service (DoS), it does not allow remote code execution, privilege escalation, or data exposure. The flaw relies on sending specially crafted hexstream requests to disrupt the service, which may affect availability but does not compromise the integrity or confidentiality of the system. Moreover, the impact is limited to crashing or temporarily disrupting the RTSP server, with no lasting damage or persistent effects once the server is restarted. \nIt's important to note that this vulnerability does not impact any Red Hat products, indicating that Red Hat's software stack is unaffected by this specific CVE.",
