    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nlibceph: fix race between delayed_work() and ceph_monc_stop()\nThe way the delayed work is handled in ceph_monc_stop() is prone to\nraces with mon_fault() and possibly also finish_hunting().  Both of\nthese can requeue the delayed work which wouldn't be canceled by any of\nthe following code in case that happens after cancel_delayed_work_sync()\nruns -- __close_session() doesn't mess with the delayed work in order\nto avoid interfering with the hunting interval logic.  This part was\nmissed in commit b5d91704f53e (\"libceph: behave in mon_fault() if\ncur_mon \u003c 0\") and use-after-free can still ensue on monc and objects\nthat hang off of it, with monc-\u003eauth and monc-\u003emonmap being\nparticularly susceptible to quickly being reused.\nTo fix this:\n- clear monc-\u003ecur_mon and monc-\u003ehunting as part of closing the session\nin ceph_monc_stop()\n- bail from delayed_work() if monc-\u003ecur_mon is cleared, similar to how\nit's done in mon_fault() and finish_hunting() (based on monc-\u003ehunting)\n- call cancel_delayed_work_sync() after the session is closed",
    "A race condition vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel. Delayed work in ceph_monc_stop() is prone to race with mon_fault() and finish_hunting(), resulting in a denial of service."
