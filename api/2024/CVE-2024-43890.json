    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ntracing: Fix overflow in get_free_elt()\n\"tracing_map-\u003enext_elt\" in get_free_elt() is at risk of overflowing.\nOnce it overflows, new elements can still be inserted into the tracing_map\neven though the maximum number of elements (`max_elts`) has been reached.\nContinuing to insert elements after the overflow could result in the\ntracing_map containing \"tracing_map-\u003emax_size\" elements, leaving no empty\nentries.\nIf any attempt is made to insert an element into a full tracing_map using\n`__tracing_map_insert()`, it will cause an infinite loop with preemption\ndisabled, leading to a CPU hang problem.\nFix this by preventing any further increments to \"tracing_map-\u003enext_elt\"\nonce it reaches \"tracing_map-\u003emax_elt\".",
    "An integer overflow vulnerability was found in the get_free_elt() function in the Linux Kernel's tracing subsystem, which is part of the tracing map logic. A local attacker with access to the tracing subsystem could exploit this vulnerability to cause a CPU hang, leading to a denial of service (DoS)."
