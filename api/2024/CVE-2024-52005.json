  "statement": "This vulnerability is classified as moderate rather than important because it primarily affects informational messages rather than directly compromising repository integrity or executing arbitrary code. The issue arises from Git's failure to sanitize ANSI escape sequences in messages received over the sideband channel, which could allow a malicious remote repository to manipulate terminal output. However, exploitation requires user interaction, such as manually copying and executing misleading commands. Unlike higher-severity vulnerabilities, this does not provide direct unauthorized access, remote code execution, or privilege escalation, limiting its overall impact. The risk is further mitigated by best practices, such as avoiding recursive clones from untrusted sources.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-52005",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Git is a source code management tool. When cloning from a server (or fetching, or pushing), informational or error messages are transported from the remote Git process to the client via the so-called \"sideband channel\". These messages will be prefixed with \"remote:\" and printed directly to the standard error output. Typically, this standard error output is connected to a terminal that understands ANSI escape sequences, which Git did not protect against. Most modern terminals support control sequences that can be used by a malicious actor to hide and misrepresent information, or to mislead the user into executing untrusted scripts. As requested on the git-security mailing list, the patches are under discussion on the public mailing list. Users are advised to update as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should avoid recursive clones unless they are from trusted sources.",
