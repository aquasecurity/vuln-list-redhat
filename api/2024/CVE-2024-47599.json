  "details": [
    "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been discovered in the gst_jpeg_dec_negotiate function in gstjpegdec.c. This function does not check for a NULL return value from gst_video_decoder_set_output_state. When this happens, dereferences of the outstate pointer will lead to a null pointer dereference. This vulnerability can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering a segmentation fault (SEGV). This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
    "A flaw was found in the GStreamer library. Insufficient error handling in the JPEG decoder can lead to NULL-pointer dereferences and cause crashes for certain input files, making it possible for a malicious actor to trigger a crash of the application."
