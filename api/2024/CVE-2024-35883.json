    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nspi: mchp-pci1xxx: Fix a possible null pointer dereference in pci1xxx_spi_probe\nIn function pci1xxxx_spi_probe, there is a potential null pointer that\nmay be caused by a failed memory allocation by the function devm_kzalloc.\nHence, a null pointer check needs to be added to prevent null pointer\ndereferencing later in the code.\nTo fix this issue, spi_bus-\u003espi_int[iter] should be checked. The memory\nallocated by devm_kzalloc will be automatically released, so just directly\nreturn -ENOMEM without worrying about memory leaks.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's spi spi-pci1xxxx.c driver in the pci1xxxx_spi_probe() function. The issue occurred due to inadequate checks, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. This flaw is caused by a failed memory allocation in the devm_kzalloc() function, which is saved in spi_bus-\u003espi_int[iter] and then used without checking, possibly leading to system instability."
