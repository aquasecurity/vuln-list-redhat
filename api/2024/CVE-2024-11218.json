  "statement": "This vulnerability marked as important severity rather than moderate because it allows a malicious Containerfile to exploit the `--mount` flag in `RUN` instructions to directly interact with the build host's filesystem. By leveraging this, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive files or inject malicious content using the privileges of the build process. In environments where the build process is executed by a root-owned Podman system service exposed to unprivileged users, this vulnerability escalates to a high level, as it enables unauthorized read/write access to high-privilege files, such as setuid executables.",
