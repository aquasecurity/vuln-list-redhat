  "details": [
    "ImageMagick is a free and open-source software suite, used for editing and manipulating digital images. The `AppImage` version `ImageMagick` might use an empty path when setting `MAGICK_CONFIGURE_PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables while executing, which might lead to arbitrary code execution by loading malicious configuration files or shared libraries in the current working directory while executing `ImageMagick`. The vulnerability is fixed in 7.11-36.",

The 'AppImage' version of ImageMagick, when executed with an empty path in the MAGICK_CONFIGURE_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables, can load malicious configuration files or shared libraries in the current directory, resulting in arbitrary code execution."
