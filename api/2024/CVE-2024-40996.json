    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nbpf: Avoid splat in pskb_pull_reason\nsyzkaller builds (CONFIG_DEBUG_NET=y) frequently trigger a debug\nhint in pskb_may_pull.\nWe'd like to retain this debug check because it might hint at integer\noverflows and other issues (kernel code should pull headers, not huge\nvalue).\nIn bpf case, this splat isn't interesting at all: such (nonsensical)\nbpf programs are typically generated by a fuzzer anyway.\nDo what Eric suggested and suppress such warning.\nFor CONFIG_DEBUG_NET=n we don't need the extra check because\npskb_may_pull will do the right thing: return an error without the\nWARN() backtrace.",
    "A vulnerability found in the Linux kernelâ€™s bpf subsystem, involving a frequent warning (splat) in pskb_may_pull during syzkaller builds (CONFIG_DEBUG_NET=y), has been resolved. The warning, caused by nonsensical BPF programs generated by fuzzers, was suppressed as it provided no useful information. For non-debug builds (CONFIG_DEBUG_NET=n), the check is unnecessary, as pskb_may_pull handles errors without triggering warnings."
