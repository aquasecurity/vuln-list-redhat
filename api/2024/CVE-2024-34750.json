  "statement": "This vulnerability in Apache Tomcat is significant due to its impact on the stability and security of web applications relying on HTTP/2. The improper handling of excessive HTTP headers during HTTP/2 stream processing leads to an inaccurate count of active streams. This miscount causes the application to apply an incorrect infinite timeout, allowing connections to persist indefinitely. Such behavior results in uncontrolled resource consumption, potentially exhausting server resources and leading to denial of service (DoS) conditions. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker could degrade the performance or availability of the server.",

  "details": [
    "Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2 stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of excessive HTTP headers correctly. This led to a miscounting of active HTTP/2 streams which in turn led to the use of an incorrect infinite timeout which allowed connections to remain open which should have been closed.\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M20, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.24, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.89.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M21, 10.1.25 or 9.0.90, which fixes the issue.",
