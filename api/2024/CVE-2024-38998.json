    "jrburke requirejs v2.3.6 was discovered to contain a prototype pollution via the function config. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via injecting arbitrary properties.",
    "A flaw was found in RequireJS. This flaw allows an attacker to alter the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype by passing arguments to the config function crafted with the built-in property: __proto__. This issue can potentially lead to a denial of service, remote code execution, or Cross-site scripting."
