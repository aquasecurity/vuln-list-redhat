  "statement": "To exploit this flaw, an attacker needs to trick a user into running grub2 with a specially crafted tar file system image, limiting the exposure of this flaw. For this reason, this vulnerability has been rated with a Moderate severity.\nThe grub2 package as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, 8, 9 and in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 is not affected by this vulnerability because the tar module is not built, so this issue is not applicable.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-45780",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in grub2. When reading tar files, grub2 allocates an internal buffer for the file name. However, it fails to properly verify the allocation against possible integer overflows. It's possible to cause the allocation length to overflow with a crafted tar file, leading to a heap out-of-bounds write. This flaw eventually allows an attacker to circumvent secure boot protections.",
