    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nmisc: fastrpc: Restrict untrusted app to attach to privileged PD\nUntrusted application with access to only non-secure fastrpc device\nnode can attach to root_pd or static PDs if it can make the respective\ninit request. This can cause problems as the untrusted application\ncan send bad requests to root_pd or static PDs. Add changes to reject\nattach to privileged PDs if the request is being made using non-secure\nfastrpc device node.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's `fastrpc` driver at allows untrusted applications with access to non-secure `fastrpc` device nodes to attach to privileged Processing Domains (PDs) such as `root_pd` or static PDs. This could lead to unauthorized access and potential exploitation."
