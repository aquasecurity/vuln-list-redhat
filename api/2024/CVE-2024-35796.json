    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnet: ll_temac: platform_get_resource replaced by wrong function\nThe function platform_get_resource was replaced with\ndevm_platform_ioremap_resource_byname and is called using 0 as name.\nThis eventually ends up in platform_get_resource_byname in the call\nstack, where it causes a null pointer in strcmp.\nif (type == resource_type(r) \u0026\u0026 !strcmp(r-\u003ename, name))\nIt should have been replaced with devm_platform_ioremap_resource.",
    "A flaw was found in the ll_temac driver for networking in the Linux kernel, which incorrectly replaces the platform_get_resource function with an inappropriate function. This issue could lead to incorrect resource handling, potentially resulting in system instability or crashes."
