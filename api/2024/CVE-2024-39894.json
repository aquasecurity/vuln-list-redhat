  "details": [
    "OpenSSH 9.5 through 9.7 before 9.8 sometimes allows timing attacks against echo-off password entry (e.g., for su and Sudo) because of an ObscureKeystrokeTiming logic error. Similarly, other timing attacks against keystroke entry could occur.",
    "A flaw was found in OpenSSH. A logic error in the SSH ObscureKeystrokeTiming feature (on by default) rendered this feature ineffective. A passive observer could still detect which network packets contained real keystrokes when the countermeasure was active because fake and real keystroke packets were being sent unconditionally."
