  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in Fedora 41's glibc implementation of getrandom() for ppc64le. This issue occurs due to an implementation error for a vDSO indirect function call and the way the return of success and possible error codes are signaled on this platform. As a result, getrandom() fails to produce randomness or may end up causing an out-of-bounds write. As the attacker has no full control over where the out-of-bounds write may happen, the most likely result is smaller data corruption or a Denial-of-Service of the affected application.\nThis issue is specific for glibc-2.40-12.fc41 as shipped with Fedora 41 only."
