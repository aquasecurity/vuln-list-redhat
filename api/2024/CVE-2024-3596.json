  "statement": "This vulnerability is of Important severity due to its ability to undermine the fundamental security mechanisms of RADIUS-based authentication systems. By exploiting the weak MD5 integrity check, an attacker can forge RADIUS responses, effectively bypassing authentication controls and gaining unauthorized access to network resources. This poses a significant threat to environments relying on RADIUS for user and device authentication, particularly those lacking enforced Message-Authenticator attributes or TLS/DTLS encryption.\nThere are several preconditions for this attack to be possible:\n*  An attacker needs man-in-the-middle network access between the RADIUS client and server\n* The client and server must be using RADIUS/UDP to communicate\n* The attacker needs to be able to trigger a RADIUS client Access-Request ( for example the client is using PAP authentication)\nDue to these attack surface limitations, the impact is rated Important.\nWithin Red Hat offerings, this impacts the FreeRADIUS package. This flaw allows a local, unauthenticated attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack to log in as a third party without knowing their credentials. Servers using Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) with required Message-Authenticator attributes or those employing TLS/DTLS encryption are not affected.",
  "acknowledgement": "",
  "name": "CVE-2024-3596",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "RADIUS Protocol under RFC 2865 is susceptible to forgery attacks by a local attacker who can modify any valid Response (Access-Accept, Access-Reject, or Access-Challenge) to any other response using a chosen-prefix collision attack against MD5 Response Authenticator signature.",
    "A vulnerability in the RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) protocol allows attackers to forge authentication responses when the Message-Authenticator attribute is not enforced. This issue arises from a cryptographically insecure integrity check using MD5, enabling attackers to spoof UDP-based RADIUS response packets. This can result in unauthorized access by modifying an Access-Reject response to an Access-Accept response, thereby compromising the authentication process."
