  "details": [
    "[REJECTED CVE] A vulnerability in the Linux kernel's memory management (mm/page_alloc) has been identified, where GFP_ATOMIC order-0 allocations could fail under memory pressure, despite available highatomic reserves. This issue caused packet loss in high-performance networking environments, as observed on Cloudflare's fleet. An attacker could theoretically exploit this by inducing high memory contention, potentially impacting real-time operations. However, since the fix ensures proper fallback behavior without introducing a security risk, the issue has been rejected as a CVE."
