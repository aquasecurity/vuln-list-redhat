    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\neeprom: at24: fix memory corruption race condition\nIf the eeprom is not accessible, an nvmem device will be registered, the\nread will fail, and the device will be torn down. If another driver\naccesses the nvmem device after the teardown, it will reference\ninvalid memory.\nMove the failure point before registering the nvmem device.",
    "CVE-2024-35848 is a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's EEPROM driver (at24) that can lead to memory corruption. The issue arises when an EEPROM device is inaccessible: the system registers an nvmem device, the read operation fails, and the device is subsequently torn down. If another driver attempts to access the nvmem device after this teardown, it may reference invalid memory, causing potential system instability. The problem has been resolved by adjusting the failure handling to occur before the nvmem device is registered, preventing access to invalid memory. Users should update their Linux kernel to a version that includes this fix to ensure system reliability."
