  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "[REJECTED CVE] A vulnerability in the Linux kernel's USB gadget subsystem allowed a race condition where gserial_disconnect could clear gser-\u003eioport during unbinding, leading to a null pointer dereference in gs_read_complete, potentially causing a kernel crash. An attacker could exploit this by repeatedly triggering gadget reconfiguration, leading to denial of service. This issue has been resolved by disabling the endpoint before setting the port to null, preventing access to freed resources."
