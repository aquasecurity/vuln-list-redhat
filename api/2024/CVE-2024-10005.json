  "statement": "This vulnerability is rated as important severity because the lack of path normalization in HashiCorp Consul allows attackers to exploit URL paths in L7 traffic intentions, bypassing defined permissions. This can compromise both confidentiality and integrity, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources, highlighting the need for immediate attention.\nThis CVE has been rated \"Low\" as RH does not use Consul/Consul Catalog as a provider for configuration discovery in Traefik Proxy. Even though the product is affected, RH products are not vulnerable.",
