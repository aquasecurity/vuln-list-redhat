  "statement": "This vulnerability represents a important severity issue due to its direct impact on the API's authentication and authorization mechanisms. By failing to properly validate the Bearer token in the Authorization header, the API inadvertently allows unauthorized users to access protected resources, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized operations. The absence of token verification bypasses the core security controls designed to restrict access, thereby exposing sensitive data and system functionalities to malicious actors.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A vulnerability was found in Forklift Controller.  There is no verification against the authorization header except to ensure it uses bearer authentication. Without an Authorization header and some form of a Bearer token, a 401 error occurs. The presence of a token value provides a 200 response with the requested information.",
