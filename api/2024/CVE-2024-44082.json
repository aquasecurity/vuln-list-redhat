  "statement": "This vulnerability in OpenStack Ironic is of high severity because it enables an authenticated user to craft malicious images that exploit the image format detection process. Since qemu-img automatically loads all image drivers to inspect the input data, an attacker can leverage unsafe features within certain image formats to trigger unexpected behaviors, including unauthorized access to sensitive memory or data leakage. The exposure of potentially sensitive data and the ability to exploit the image processing pipeline pose high risks to system integrity, particularly in environments like OpenStack Ironic, where bare-metal provisioning demands secure and precise control of image operations.",
