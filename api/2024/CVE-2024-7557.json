  "statement": "This vulnerability represents a important severity issue due to its impact on both authentication and authorization mechanisms within OpenShift AI. By allowing ServiceAccount tokens to be shared and reused across models within the same namespace, it breaks the isolation expected between different workloads, enabling privilege escalation and lateral movement. This breach in security undermines the integrity of the platform by permitting unauthorized access to sensitive models and APIs, which can lead to data exfiltration, tampering, or misuse of resources. The exposure of ServiceAccount tokens in the UI amplifies the attack surface, making it trivial for an attacker to exploit these elevated privileges.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A vulnerability was found in OpenShift AI that allows for authentication bypass and privilege escalation across models within the same namespace. When deploying AI models, the UI provides the option to protect models with authentication. However, credentials from one model can be used to access other models and APIs within the same namespace. The exposed ServiceAccount tokens, visible in the UI, can be utilized with oc --token={token} to exploit the elevated view privileges associated with the ServiceAccount, leading to unauthorized access to additional resources.",
