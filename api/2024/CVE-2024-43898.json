  "details": [
    "[REJECTED CVE] A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability has been identified in the Linux Kernel's ext4 filesystem. The issue occurs during concurrent write operations with inline data, where an ext4_force_shutdown is triggered due to inconsistencies like \"block bitmap and bg descriptor inconsistent.\" This shutdown disrupts inline data handling, failing to restore the EXT4_STATE_MAY_INLINE_DATA flag. As a result, subsequent operations, such as in ext4_da_write_end, may attempt to dereference an unset page folio private pointer, leading to potential kernel crashes."
