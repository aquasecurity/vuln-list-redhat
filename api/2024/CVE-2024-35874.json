  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\naio: Fix null ptr deref in aio_complete() wakeup\nlist_del_init_careful() needs to be the last access to the wait queue\nentry - it effectively unlocks access.\nPreviously, finish_wait() would see the empty list head and skip taking\nthe lock, and then we'd return - but the completion path would still\nattempt to do the wakeup after the task_struct pointer had been\noverwritten.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel that causes a NULL pointer dereference in the `aio_complete()` function during a wakeup operation. The issue arises because `finish_wait()` may skip locking if it encounters an empty list head. This leads to a NULL pointer dereference when attempting a wakeup after the task structure pointer is overwritten."
