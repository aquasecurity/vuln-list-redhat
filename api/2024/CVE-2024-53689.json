  "details": [
    "[REJECTED CVE] A vulnerability was identified in the Linux kernelâ€™s block subsystem, where the queue_attr_store function incorrectly acquires the sysfs_lock after freezing the queue, leading to a potential deadlock. This incorrect locking order triggers a circular locking dependency, which can be consistently reproduced by simply accessing /sys/kernel/debug via the ls command. An attacker could exploit this issue by inducing race conditions through repeated file system access, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS) by forcing the system into an unrecoverable deadlock."
