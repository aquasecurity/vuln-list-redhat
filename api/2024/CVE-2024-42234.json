  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nmm: fix crashes from deferred split racing folio migration\nEven on 6.10-rc6, I've been seeing elusive \"Bad page state\"s (often on\nflags when freeing, yet the flags shown are not bad: PG_locked had been\nset and cleared??), and VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_ref_count(page) == 0)s from\ndeferred_split_scan()'s folio_put(), and a variety of other BUG and WARN\nsymptoms implying double free by deferred split and large folio migration.\n6.7 commit 9bcef5973e31 (\"mm: memcg: fix split queue list crash when large\nfolio migration\") was right to fix the memcg-dependent locking broken in\n85ce2c517ade (\"memcontrol: only transfer the memcg data for migration\"),\nbut missed a subtlety of deferred_split_scan(): it moves folios to its own\nlocal list to work on them without split_queue_lock, during which time\nfolio-\u003e_deferred_list is not empty, but even the \"right\" lock does nothing\nto secure the folio and the list it is on.\nFortunately, deferred_split_scan() is careful to use folio_try_get(): so\nfolio_migrate_mapping() can avoid the race by folio_undo_large_rmappable()\nwhile the old folio's reference count is temporarily frozen to 0 - adding\nsuch a freeze in the !mapping case too (originally, folio lock and\nunmapping and no swap cache left an anon folio unreachable, so no freezing\nwas needed there: but the deferred split queue offers a way to reach it).",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The \"mm: fix crashes from deferred split racing folio migration\" commit involved race conditions during large folio handling. Issues arising from deferred splitting and migration processes where improper locking led to double frees and inconsistencies, such as \"Bad page state\" errors and failed assertions were fixed. The fix improves locking mechanisms and reference management for folios, ensuring safe operations even when folios are temporarily managed outside of global locks."
