  "statement": "This vulnerability in the Python `venv` module is rated as moderate rather than important because it relies on a specific set of conditions to be exploitable, limiting its impact. An attacker would need to have control over the virtual environment creation process and access to the environment setup, which is less common in typical usage scenarios. Furthermore, the vulnerability only poses a risk if users activate the malicious virtual environment through `source venv/bin/activate` or similar scripts, as direct invocation of the virtual environment without activation (`./venv/bin/python`) is not affected.\nVersions of python36:3.6/python36 and python39:3.9/python39 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 are marked as 'Not affected' as they just provide \"symlinks\" to the main python3 component, which provides the actual interpreter of the Python programming language.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A vulnerability has been found in the CPython `venv` module and CLI where path names provided when creating a virtual environment were not quoted properly, allowing the creator to inject commands into virtual environment \"activation\" scripts (ie \"source venv/bin/activate\"). This means that attacker-controlled virtual environments are able to run commands when the virtual environment is activated. Virtual environments which are not created by an attacker or which aren't activated before being used (ie \"./venv/bin/python\") are not affected.",
