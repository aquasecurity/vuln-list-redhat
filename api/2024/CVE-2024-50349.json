  "details": [
    "Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When Git asks for credentials via a terminal prompt (i.e. without using any credential helper), it prints out the host name for which the user is expected to provide a username and/or a password. At this stage, any URL-encoded parts have been decoded already, and are printed verbatim. This allows attackers to craft URLs that contain ANSI escape sequences that the terminal interpret to confuse users e.g. into providing passwords for trusted Git hosting sites when in fact they are then sent to untrusted sites that are under the attacker's control. This issue has been patch via commits `7725b81` and `c903985` which are included in release versions v2.48.1, v2.47.1, v2.46.3, v2.45.3, v2.44.3, v2.43.6, v2.42.4, v2.41.3, and v2.40.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid cloning from untrusted URLs, especially recursive clones.",
    "A flaw was found in Git. This vulnerability occurs when Git requests credentials via a terminal prompt, for example, without the use of a credential helper. During this process, Git displays the host name for which the credentials are needed, but any URL-encoded parts are decoded and displayed directly. This can allow an attacker to manipulate URLs by including ANSI escape sequences, which can be interpreted by the terminal to mislead users by tricking them into entering passwords that are redirected to malicious attacker-controlled sites."
