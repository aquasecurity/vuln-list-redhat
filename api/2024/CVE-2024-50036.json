    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnet: do not delay dst_entries_add() in dst_release()\ndst_entries_add() uses per-cpu data that might be freed at netns\ndismantle from ip6_route_net_exit() calling dst_entries_destroy()\nBefore ip6_route_net_exit() can be called, we release all\nthe dsts associated with this netns, via calls to dst_release(),\nwhich waits an rcu grace period before calling dst_destroy()\ndst_entries_add() use in dst_destroy() is racy, because\ndst_entries_destroy() could have been called already.\nDecrementing the number of dsts must happen sooner.\nNotes:\n1) in CONFIG_XFRM case, dst_destroy() can call\ndst_release_immediate(child), this might also cause UAF\nif the child does not have DST_NOCOUNT set.\nIPSEC maintainers might take a look and see how to address this.\n2) There is also discussion about removing this count of dst,\nwhich might happen in future kernels."
