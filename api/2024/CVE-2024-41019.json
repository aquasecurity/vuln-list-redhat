    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nfs/ntfs3: Validate ff offset\nThis adds sanity checks for ff offset. There is a check\non rt-\u003efirst_free at first, but walking through by ff\nwithout any check. If the second ff is a large offset.\nWe may encounter an out-of-bound read.",
    "A flaw was found in the `fs/ntfs3` module in the Linux kernel. This issue involved inadequate validation of the `ff` offset, which could lead to out-of-bounds reads if the offset was excessively large. This flaw posed risks of crashes and information leaks, and has been addressed by adding sanity checks to validate the `ff` offset before use, ensuring safer memory access and improving system stability."
