  "statement": "The issue is classified as moderate severity rather than important because, while it allows an unauthenticated user to trigger a denial of service (DoS) by sending a specific extended search request, it does not compromise the integrity or confidentiality of the system. The vulnerability is limited to service availability, meaning the server can crash and become temporarily unavailable, but no data is leaked, altered, or accessed by unauthorized users. Additionally, recovery from this condition typically involves restarting the service, which can be automated or handled through monitoring tools, thus limiting the long-term impact. Since the flaw does not facilitate unauthorized access or privilege escalation, it is considered moderate in severity.",
