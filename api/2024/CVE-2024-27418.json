    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnet: mctp: take ownership of skb in mctp_local_output\nCurrently, mctp_local_output only takes ownership of skb on success, and\nwe may leak an skb if mctp_local_output fails in specific states; the\nskb ownership isn't transferred until the actual output routing occurs.\nInstead, make mctp_local_output free the skb on all error paths up to\nthe route action, so it always consumes the passed skb.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's Management Component Transport Protocol (MCTP) networking subsystem. This issue occurs in `mctp_local_output`, where improper handling of the socket buffer (`skb`) could lead to security vulnerabilities."
