  "statement": "The vulnerability in Traefik that allows bypassing IP allow-lists via HTTP/3 early data requests in QUIC 0-RTT handshakes, while notable, is categorized as moderate severity rather than important. This classification stems from the requirement for an attacker to leverage HTTP/3's early data feature and perform spoofed IP address manipulation to exploit the flaw. As a result, successful exploitation demands specific conditions, including network-level access and manipulation capabilities, which may not be trivial in many environments.",
