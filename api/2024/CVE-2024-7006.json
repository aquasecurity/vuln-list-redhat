  "statement": "The null pointer dereference flaw in Libtiff via tif_dirinfo.c is classified as a moderate severity issue rather than a higher severity one because, while it can cause an application crash leading to denial of service, it does not directly compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data beyond causing downtime. The impact is localized to application stability rather than enabling remote code execution, privilege escalation, or unauthorized data access. Furthermore, exploiting this flaw requires conditions such as inducing memory allocation failures or manipulating the heap, which limits the attack surface and reduces the likelihood of successful exploitation in typical deployment environments.",

  "details": [
    "A null pointer dereference flaw was found in Libtiff via `tif_dirinfo.c`. This issue may allow an attacker to trigger memory allocation failures through certain means, such as restricting the heap space size or injecting faults, causing a segmentation fault. This can cause an application crash, eventually leading to a denial of service.",
