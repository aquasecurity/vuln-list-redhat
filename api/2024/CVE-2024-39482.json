  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nbcache: fix variable length array abuse in btree_iter\nbtree_iter is used in two ways: either allocated on the stack with a\nfixed size MAX_BSETS, or from a mempool with a dynamic size based on the\nspecific cache set. Previously, the struct had a fixed-length array of\nsize MAX_BSETS which was indexed out-of-bounds for the dynamically-sized\niterators, which causes UBSAN to complain.\nThis patch uses the same approach as in bcachefs's sort_iter and splits\nthe iterator into a btree_iter with a flexible array member and a\nbtree_iter_stack which embeds a btree_iter as well as a fixed-length\ndata array."
