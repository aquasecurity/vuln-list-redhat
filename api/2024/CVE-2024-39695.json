    "Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.2. The vulnerability is in the parser for the ASF video format, which was a new feature in v0.28.0. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file. The bug is fixed in version v0.28.3.",
    "A flaw was found in the Exiv2 library. An out-of-bounds read can be triggered when the metadata of a specially crafted ASF video file is processed, causing the application linked to the library to crash, resulting in a denial of service."
