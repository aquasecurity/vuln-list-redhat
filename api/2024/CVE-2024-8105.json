  "statement": "PKFail is a supply chain security issue in which an untrusted private key was used for firmware development and production devices, This helps attackers to perform malicious operations because we currently have lot of devices in the filed that connects to the same leaked key, used across multiple vendors for crystallographic data preservation. These encryption keys should ideally assure platform security of devices secured with Secure Boot.\nThis vulnerability would theoretically allow an attacker to sign device firmware that could bypass the protections that Secure Boot enables, compromising the trust chain of the device firmware and operating system. Only privileged user with physical access or with root access can use UEFI-update to do this.\nWe recommend to upgrade system firmware (to the last), please contact your hardware vendor for more update on this.",
