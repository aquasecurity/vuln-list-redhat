  "statement": "PKFail is a supply chain security issue in which an untrusted private key was used for firmware development and production devices. This helps attackers perform malicious operations because we currently have a lot of devices in the field that connect to the same leaked key, used across multiple vendors for crystallographic data preservation. These encryption keys should ideally assure platform security of devices secured with Secure Boot.\nThis vulnerability would theoretically allow an attacker to sign device firmware that could bypass the protections that Secure Boot enables, compromising the trust chain of the device firmware and operating system. Only privileged user with physical access or with root access can use UEFI-update to do this.\nWe recommend to upgrade system firmware (to the last), please contact your hardware vendor for more update on this.",

  "details": [
    "A vulnerability related to the use an insecure Platform Key (PK) has been discovered. An attacker with the compromised PK private key can create malicious UEFI software that is signed with a trusted key that has been compromised.",
    "A flaw was found in PKfail, a firmware supply-chain issue affecting hundreds of device models in the UEFI ecosystem. The Secure Boot \"master key,\" known as the Platform Key, which manages the Secure Boot databases and maintains the chain of trust from firmware to the operating system, is often not replaced by OEMs or device vendors. This issue results in devices shipping with untrusted keys. This flaw allows an attacker with access to the private part of the PK to bypass Secure Boot by manipulating the Key Exchange Key (KEK) database, the Signature Database (db), and the Forbidden Signature Database (dbx)."
