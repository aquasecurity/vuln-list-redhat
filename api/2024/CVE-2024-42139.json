    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nice: Fix improper extts handling\nExtts events are disabled and enabled by the application ts2phc.\nHowever, in case where the driver is removed when the application is\nrunning, a specific extts event remains enabled and can cause a kernel\ncrash.\nAs a side effect, when the driver is reloaded and application is started\nagain, remaining extts event for the channel from a previous run will\nkeep firing and the message \"extts on unexpected channel\" might be\nprinted to the user.\nTo avoid that, extts events shall be disabled when PTP is released."
