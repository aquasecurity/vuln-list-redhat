    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nmm: turn folio_test_hugetlb into a PageType\nThe current folio_test_hugetlb() can be fooled by a concurrent folio split\ninto returning true for a folio which has never belonged to hugetlbfs. \nThis can't happen if the caller holds a refcount on it, but we have a few\nplaces (memory-failure, compaction, procfs) which do not and should not\ntake a speculative reference.\nSince hugetlb pages do not use individual page mapcounts (they are always\nfully mapped and use the entire_mapcount field to record the number of\nmappings), the PageType field is available now that page_mapcount()\nignores the value in this field.\nIn compaction and with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM enabled, the current implementation\ncan result in an oops, as reported by Luis. This happens since 9c5ccf2db04b\n(\"mm: remove HUGETLB_PAGE_DTOR\") effectively added some VM_BUG_ON() checks\nin the PageHuge() testing path.\n[willy@infradead.org: update vmcoreinfo]\nLink: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/ZgGZUvsdhaT1Va-T@casper.infradead.org",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's memory management system, specifically affecting the handling of hugetlb (huge page) memory. The issue arises from the `folio_test_hugetlb()` function, which can be misled by a concurrent folio split, potentially returning incorrect results for folios that do not belong to hugetlbfs. This can lead to problems in memory failure handling, compaction, and procfs, and may cause kernel crashes (oops) when `CONFIG_DEBUG_VM` is enabled."
