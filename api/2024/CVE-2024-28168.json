XXE flaws can be exploited to access sensitive internal files, such as configuration or credential files, leading to data exposure without authorization. Additionally, XXE attacks may enable attackers to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF), allowing them to make unauthorized requests to internal systems or services, potentially pivoting within a network.",
