    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ns390/dasd: Fix invalid dereferencing of indirect CCW data pointer\nFix invalid dereferencing of indirect CCW data pointer in\ndasd_eckd_dump_sense() that leads to a kernel panic in error cases.\nWhen using indirect addressing for DASD CCWs (IDAW) the CCW CDA pointer\ndoes not contain the data address itself but a pointer to the IDAL.\nThis needs to be translated from physical to virtual as well before\nusing it.\nThis dereferencing is also used for dasd_page_cache and also fixed\nalthough it is very unlikely that this code path ever gets used.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the `s390/dasd` subsystem in the Linux Kernel, where an invalid dereferencing of an indirect Channel Command Word (CCW) data pointer could cause a kernel panic. The issue occurs due to the CCW Command Data Address (CDA) pointer used with indirect addressing (IDAW), which needs proper translation from physical to virtual memory."
