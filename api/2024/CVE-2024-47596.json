  "details": [
    "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read has been discovered in the qtdemux_parse_svq3_stsd_data function within qtdemux.c. In the FOURCC_SMI_ case, seqh_size is read from the input file without proper validation. If seqh_size is greater than the remaining size of the data buffer, it can lead to an OOB-read in the following call to gst_buffer_fill, which internally uses memcpy. This vulnerability can result in reading up to 4GB of process memory or potentially causing a segmentation fault (SEGV) when accessing invalid memory. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
    "A flaw was found in the GStreamer library. An integer underflow due to missing size checks in the MP4/MOV demuxer can lead to out-of-bounds reads and cause crashes for certain input files. This issue can allow a malicious actor to trigger a crash of the application."
