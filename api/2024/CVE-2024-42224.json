  "statement": "Red Hat believes this flaw to be of Moderate severity because this flaw primarily impacts an Ethernet switch driver, which operates at the network interface level, handling network data packets. As such, successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in memory leakage but it would likely not contain sensitive data. A crash could impact the integrity of the system, but would most likely impact the integrity of the data flow within the network.",

    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnet: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Correct check for empty list\nSince commit a3c53be55c95 (\"net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Support multiple MDIO\nbusses\") mv88e6xxx_default_mdio_bus() has checked that the\nreturn value of list_first_entry() is non-NULL.\nThis appears to be intended to guard against the list chip-\u003emdios being\nempty.  However, it is not the correct check as the implementation of\nlist_first_entry is not designed to return NULL for empty lists.\nInstead, use list_first_entry_or_null() which does return NULL if the\nlist is empty.\nFlagged by Smatch.\nCompile tested only.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's mv88e6xxx driver in the mv88e6xxx_default_mdio_bus() function, where an improper check for an empty linked list could lead to dereferencing a potentially invalid pointer. This issue could lead to memory corruption or crashes."
