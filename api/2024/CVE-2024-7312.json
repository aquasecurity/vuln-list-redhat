  "statement": "The Open Redirect vulnerability in the Payara Server REST Management Interface modules is classified as a moderate severity issue due to its reliance on additional exploit scenarios and the need for user interaction. While the vulnerability can potentially lead to session hijacking or phishing attacks, its impact is contingent upon an attacker successfully tricking a user into visiting a malicious URL. This reliance on user action, coupled with the necessity of additional contextual exploitation, reduces the immediate risk compared to more direct vulnerabilities. Additionally, the server-side exposure is mitigated by the inherent security measures of the Payara Server and the requirement for valid session tokens or authentication credentials.",
