  "statement": "This vulnerability is classified as low severity rather than moderate because it only affects applications that explicitly call SSL_free_buffers, a rarely used OpenSSL function. \nThe issue arises in specific conditions where the function is called while a buffer is still in use, leading to a potential use-after-free scenario. However, exploitation is significantly constrained because\n(1) an application must intentionally invoke this function, which is not typical in common OpenSSL usage, \n(2) triggering the vulnerability requires precise timing and conditions where partially processed records remain unread or incomplete, and \n(3) there are no known active exploits leveraging this issue. \nGiven these factors, while the bug could theoretically lead to crashes or corruption, the practical risk of widespread exploitation remains minimal.",

  "details": [
    "Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_free_buffers may cause\nmemory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations\nImpact summary: A use after free can have a range of potential consequences such\nas the corruption of valid data, crashes or execution of arbitrary code.\nHowever, only applications that directly call the SSL_free_buffers function are\naffected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not\nvulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by\napplications.\nThe SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used\nwhen processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected\nto succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have\nbeen identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.\nThe first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the\nnetwork and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived.\nIn this case calling SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though a record has only\nbeen partially processed and the buffer is still in use.\nThe second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has\nbeen received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of\nthis data. Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer\nis still in use.\nWhile these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a\nmalicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.\nWe are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.",
