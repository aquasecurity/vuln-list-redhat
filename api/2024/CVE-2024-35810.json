    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ndrm/vmwgfx: Fix the lifetime of the bo cursor memory\nThe cleanup can be dispatched while the atomic update is still active,\nwhich means that the memory acquired in the atomic update needs to\nnot be invalidated by the cleanup. The buffer objects in vmw_plane_state\ninstead of using the builtin map_and_cache were trying to handle\nthe lifetime of the mapped memory themselves, leading to crashes.\nUse the map_and_cache instead of trying to manage the lifetime of the\nbuffer objects held by the vmw_plane_state.\nFixes kernel oops'es in IGT's kms_cursor_legacy forked-bo.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the drm/vmwgfx driver in the Linux kernel, concerning the lifetime management of the buffer object (BO) cursor memory. This issue occurs due to improper handling of the cursor memory's lifecycle, which could lead to use-after-free errors or crashes."
