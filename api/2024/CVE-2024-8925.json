  "details": [
    "In PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.30, 8.2.* before 8.2.24, 8.3.* before 8.3.12, erroneous parsing of multipart form data contained in an HTTP POST request could lead to legitimate data not being processed. This could lead to malicious attacker able to control part of the submitted data being able to exclude portion of other data, potentially leading to erroneous application behavior.",
    "A flaw was found in PHP's parsing of multipart form data contents, which affects both file and input form data. This may lead to legitimate data not being processed, violating data integrity. For example, if a multipart form data payload contains a valid prefix 'X' of the defined boundary B such that 5Kib \u003c |X| \u003c |B| \u003c 8Kib, the logic responsible for parsing and storing the multipart payload fails to correctly extract the contents between two boundaries."
