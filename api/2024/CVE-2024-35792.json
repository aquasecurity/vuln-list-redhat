  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ncrypto: rk3288 - Fix use after free in unprepare\nThe unprepare call must be carried out before the finalize call\nas the latter can free the request.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's rockchip rk3288_crypto_ahash.c driver in the rk_hash_run() function, where a use-after-free scenario can occur. This flaw is caused by improper function call ordering, whereÂ  rk_hash_unprepare() is called after crypto_finalize_hash_request(). This may free some of the memory used by rk_hash_unprepare() and lead to a use-after-free, possibly leading to memory corruption or system instability."
