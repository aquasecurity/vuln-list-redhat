  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nbtrfs: qgroup: fix quota root leak after quota disable failure\nIf during the quota disable we fail when cleaning the quota tree or when\ndeleting the root from the root tree, we jump to the 'out' label without\never dropping the reference on the quota root, resulting in a leak of the\nroot since fs_info-\u003equota_root is no longer pointing to the root (we have\nset it to NULL just before those steps).\nFix this by always doing a btrfs_put_root() call under the 'out' label.\nThis is a problem that exists since qgroups were first added in 2012 by\ncommit bed92eae26cc (\"Btrfs: qgroup implementation and prototypes\"), but\nback then we missed a kfree on the quota root and free_extent_buffer()\ncalls on its root and commit root nodes, since back then roots were not\nyet reference counted.",
    "A vulnerability in the Btrfs file system in the Linux Kernel was fixed to address a memory leak issue. When disabling quotas, if an error occurred during quota tree cleanup or root deletion, the code failed to release the reference to the quota root node, leading to a resource leak. The fix involved adding a `btrfs_put_root()` call in the error handling path to ensure proper reference counting and prevent memory leaks. This problem has been present since quota groups were introduced in 2012 but was only addressed recently."
