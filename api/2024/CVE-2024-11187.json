  "details": [
    "It is possible to construct a zone such that some queries to it will generate responses containing numerous records in the Additional section. An attacker sending many such queries can cause either the authoritative server itself or an independent resolver to use disproportionate resources processing the queries. Zones will usually need to have been deliberately crafted to attack this exposure.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.0 through 9.11.37, 9.16.0 through 9.16.50, 9.18.0 through 9.18.32, 9.20.0 through 9.20.4, 9.21.0 through 9.21.3, 9.11.3-S1 through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.50-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.32-S1.",
    "A flaw was found in the bind package where a crafted DNS zone may generate numerous records in the 'Additional' section of the response. This flaw allows an attacker to send a large amount of such queries, which may lead either the authoritative server or an independent resolver to run into an uncontrolled CPU resource scenario, ultimately resulting in the server not being able to attend new requests and causing a denial of service as a consequence."
