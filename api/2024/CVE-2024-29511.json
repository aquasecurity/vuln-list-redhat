  "statement": "The CVE-2024-29511 vulnerability in Ghostscript, when used with Tesseract for OCR, is classified as a moderate severity issue rather than a important one due to its limited exploitability and scope of impact. The vulnerability primarily allows for directory traversal to read and write error messages to arbitrary files, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information. However, it does not facilitate remote code execution (RCE) or direct system compromise. Exploitation requires specific conditions, such as Ghostscript being compiled with Tesseract support and the attacker having the capability to supply crafted Postscript files. The inherent need for precise conditions and lack of direct execution capabilities mitigate the overall risk, rendering the issue moderate rather than important.",

  "details": [
    "Artifex Ghostscript before 10.03.1, when Tesseract is used for OCR, has a directory traversal issue that allows arbitrary file reading (and writing of error messages to arbitrary files) via OCRLanguage. For example, exploitation can use debug_file /tmp/out and user_patterns_file /etc/passwd.",
    "A vulnerability was found in Ghostscript. When Tesseract is used for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), a directory traversal issue allows arbitrary file reading and writing of error messages to arbitrary files via theÂ  OCRLanguage. This issue causes an arbitrary file read/write through the Tesseract configuration."
