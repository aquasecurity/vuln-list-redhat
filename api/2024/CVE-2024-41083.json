    "A flaw was found in `netfs_page_mkwrite()` in the Linux kernel caused by a missing validation check for `folio-\u003emapping` after acquiring the folio lock. This oversight could lead to a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in kernel crashes when handling file operations. The issue arose from interference by `invalidate_inode_pages2_range()` during Direct I/O (DIO) writes."
