    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nx86/kexec: Fix bug with call depth tracking\nThe call to cc_platform_has() triggers a fault and system crash if call depth\ntracking is active because the GS segment has been reset by load_segments() and\nGS_BASE is now 0 but call depth tracking uses per-CPU variables to operate.\nCall cc_platform_has() earlier in the function when GS is still valid.\n[ bp: Massage. ]",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's x86/kexec component, where the function call to cc_platform_has() could lead to a system crash when call depth tracking is active. This issue occurs because the GS segment is reset by load_segments(), setting GS_BASE to 0, while call depth tracking relies on per-CPU variables."
