  "details": [
    "jetty 6.0.x (jetty6) beta16 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary script source code via a capital P in the .jsp extension, and probably other mixed case manipulations.",
    "A flaw was found in Jetty that could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. If an attacker sends a specially-crafted request for a known \".jsp\" file using an uppercase letter P in the file extension (.jsP), the requested file's source code will be returned if the file system being used is case-sensitive."
