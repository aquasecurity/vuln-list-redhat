  "details": [
    "Xen 4.1.x and 4.2.x, when the XSA-45 patch is in place, does not properly maintain references on pages stored for deferred cleanup, which allows local PV guest kernels to cause a denial of service (premature page free and hypervisor crash) or possibly gain privileges via unspecified vectors."
