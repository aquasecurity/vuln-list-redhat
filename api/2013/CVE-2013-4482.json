  "details": [
    "Untrusted search path vulnerability in python-paste-script (aka paster) in Luci 0.26.0, when started using the initscript, allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse .egg-info file in the (1) current working directory or (2) its parent directories.",
    "A flaw was found in the way the luci service was initialized. If a system administrator started the luci service from a directory that was writable to by a local user, that user could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code as the root or luci user."
