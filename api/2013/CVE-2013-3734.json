  "statement": "This issue is not a security flaw as, on its own, it does not cross a trust boundary in the system.  In order to access the datasource password, you must be logged in to jopr as an administrative user, that has permission to (among other things) execute code, deploy applications and reset the password in question.  The administrative user has the privileges to reset the password, hence, this does not expose any information that is not otherwise visible.\nAs administrative interfaces often display or allow the transmission of sensitive information, it is recommended best-practice that SSL is configured for the administrative console, regardless of this issue.",

  "name": "CVE-2013-3734",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The Embedded Jopr component in JBoss Application Server includes the cleartext datasource password in unspecified HTML responses, which might allow (1) man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging failure to use SSL or (2) attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading the HTML source code.  NOTE: the vendor says that this does not cross a trust boundary and that it is recommended best-practice that SSL is configured for the administrative console"
