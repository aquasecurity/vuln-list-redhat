    "Luci in Red Hat Conga does not properly enforce the user session timeout, which might allow attackers to gain access to the session by reading the __ac session cookie.  NOTE: this issue has been SPLIT due to different vulnerability types. Use CVE-2012-3359 for the base64-encoded storage of the user and password in a cookie.",
    "It was discovered that luci stored usernames and passwords in session cookies. This issue prevented the session inactivity timeout feature from working correctly, and allowed attackers able to get access to a session cookie to obtain the victim's authentication credentials."
