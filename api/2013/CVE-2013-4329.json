  "details": [
    "The xenlight library (libxl) in Xen 4.0.x through 4.2.x, when IOMMU is disabled, provides access to a busmastering-capable PCI passthrough device before the IOMMU setup is complete, which allows local HVM guest domains to gain privileges or cause a denial of service via a DMA instruction."
