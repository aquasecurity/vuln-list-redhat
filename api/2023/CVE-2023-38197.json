    "An issue was discovered in Qt before 5.15.15, 6.x before 6.2.10, and 6.3.x through 6.5.x before 6.5.3. There are infinite loops in recursive entity expansion.",
    "A vulnerability was found in Qtbase, where it is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by an infinite loop flaw in the QXmlStreamReader() function. This flaw occurs because the QXmlStreamReader function accepts multiple DOCTYPE elements containing DTD fragments in the XML prolog and the XML body. Well-formed but invalid XML files - with multiple DTD fragments in prolog and body, combined with recursive entity expansions, causes infinite loops in QXmlStreamReader. By persuading a victim to open specially crafted XML content, an attacker can cause a denial of service condition."
