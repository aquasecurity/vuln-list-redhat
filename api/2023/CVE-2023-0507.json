  "details": [
    "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Starting with the 8.1 branch, Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core plugin GeoMap. The stored XSS vulnerability was possible due to map attributions weren't properly sanitized and allowed arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in the context of the currently authorized user of the Grafana instance. An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a panel to include a map attribution containing JavaScript. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard. Users may upgrade to version 8.5.21, 9.2.13 and 9.3.8 to receive a fix.",
    "A flaw was found in the GeoMap Grafana plugin, where a user can store unsanitized HTML in the GeoMap plugin under the Attribution text field, and the client will process it. The vulnerability makes it possible to use XHR to make arbitrary API calls on behalf of the attacked user. This means that a malicious user with editor permissions could alter a GeoMap panel to include JavaScript that changes the password for the user viewing the panel (this could be an admin) to a known password, thus gaining access to the admin account and resulting as the editor becoming an admin."
