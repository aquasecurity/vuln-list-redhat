    "[REJECTED CVE] A vulnerability was identified in the Bluetooth subsystem of the Linux kernel within the hci_conn_cleanup function. When cleaning up connections, the same object could be freed multiple times due to redundant calls to hci_dev_put and hci_conn_put after it was already released by hci_conn_del_sysfs."
