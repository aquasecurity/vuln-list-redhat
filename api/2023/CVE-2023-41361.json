  "statement": "In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9, the vulnerable code is not included. It was added much later during the development of the 9.x version of FRR in upstream. The highest version of FRR utilized in RHEL is 8.5. Consequently, none of the FRR versions shipped in RHEL are affected by this vulnerability.",

  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in FRRouting FRR 9.0. bgpd/bgp_open.c does not check for an overly large length of the rcv software version.",
    "A vulnerability was found in FRRouting stemming from a boundary error in bgpd/bgp_open.c. The issue arises because it fails to check for an excessively large length of the received software version (rcv). This flaw allows a remote attacker to overflow a buffer by sending specially crafted data to the application, leading to a denial of service condition."
