    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnet: nfc: fix races in nfc_llcp_sock_get() and nfc_llcp_sock_get_sn()\nSili Luo reported a race in nfc_llcp_sock_get(), leading to UAF.\nGetting a reference on the socket found in a lookup while\nholding a lock should happen before releasing the lock.\nnfc_llcp_sock_get_sn() has a similar problem.\nFinally nfc_llcp_recv_snl() needs to make sure the socket\nfound by nfc_llcp_sock_from_sn() does not disappear.",
    "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in the net:nfc component and is caused by a race condition in the nfc_llcp_sock_get() function. This flaw could lead to memory corruption, crashes, or potential exploitation by attackers of privileged memory."
