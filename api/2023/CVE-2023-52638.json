  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ncan: j1939: prevent deadlock by changing j1939_socks_lock to rwlock\nThe following 3 locks would race against each other, causing the\ndeadlock situation in the Syzbot bug report:\n- j1939_socks_lock\n- active_session_list_lock\n- sk_session_queue_lock\nA reasonable fix is to change j1939_socks_lock to an rwlock, since in\nthe rare situations where a write lock is required for the linked list\nthat j1939_socks_lock is protecting, the code does not attempt to\nacquire any more locks. This would break the circular lock dependency,\nwhere, for example, the current thread already locks j1939_socks_lock\nand attempts to acquire sk_session_queue_lock, and at the same time,\nanother thread attempts to acquire j1939_socks_lock while holding\nsk_session_queue_lock.\nNOTE: This patch along does not fix the unregister_netdevice bug\nreported by Syzbot; instead, it solves a deadlock situation to prepare\nfor one or more further patches to actually fix the Syzbot bug, which\nappears to be a reference counting problem within the j1939 codebase.\n[mkl: remove unrelated newline change]",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol, within the J1939 protocol implementation. This issue occurs due to a potential deadlock caused by a race condition involving three locks: j1939_socks_lock, active_session_list_lock, and sk_session_queue_lock. This issue was identified in a Syzbot bug report."
