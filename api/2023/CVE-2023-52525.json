    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nwifi: mwifiex: Fix oob check condition in mwifiex_process_rx_packet\nOnly skip the code path trying to access the rfc1042 headers when the\nbuffer is too small, so the driver can still process packets without\nrfc1042 headers.",
    "An out-of-bounds vulnerability was found in the mwifiex_process_rx_packet() function in the Linux kernel, which occurs from improper boundary checks when accessing the RFC1042 headers in received packets. If the packet buffer is too small, the function skips code paths that handle these headers, which could lead to incorrect packet processing and a potential out-of-bounds access, causing a crash or memory corruption."
