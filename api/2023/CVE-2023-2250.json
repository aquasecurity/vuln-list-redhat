    "A flaw was found in the Open Cluster Management (OCM) when a user have access to the worker nodes which has the cluster-manager-registration-controller or cluster-manager deployments. A malicious user can take advantage of this and bind the cluster-admin to any service account or using the service account to list all secrets for all kubernetes namespaces, leading into a cluster-level privilege escalation.",
