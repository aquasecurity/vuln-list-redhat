  "statement": "Red Hat Build of Quarkus flaw happens because the cookie contains a token that token could potentially be more useful to attackers than a normal session cookie hijacking attack. Other potentially higher security applications may accept the same token from the cookie, while with a normal session hijacking attack it is limited to the application that issued the cookie.\nAn attacker needs to have compromised a significant amount of your infrastructure to get the cookie. For this reason, the flaw is rated Low impact",

  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in Quarkus. Quarkus OIDC can leak both ID and access tokens in the authorization code flow when an insecure HTTP protocol is used, which can allow attackers to access sensitive user data directly from the ID token or by using the access token to access user data from OIDC provider services. Please note that passwords are not stored in access tokens.",
