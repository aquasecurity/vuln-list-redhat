  "statement": "\"Mayhem\" is a potent attack technique that focuses on the core components of computing systems, specifically the CPU internals and stack variables. This method signifies a noteworthy advancement in cyber threats, demonstrating a successful ability to tamper with a computer's memory and compromise both stack and register variables. Capitalizing on the well-known Rowhammer effect, wherein swift access to a DRAM row induces bit flips in neighboring rows, this clever attack exploits these bit flips to disrupt stack variables and manipulate register values within a given process. The manipulation is accomplished by targeting register values stored in the process's stack, which, once flushed out to memory, become vulnerable to Rowhammer attacks. When reloaded, these corrupted values cause chaos, compromising the integrity of the entire process. It's important to note that this attack is confined to the local system, leading us to categorize it as a moderate threat.",
