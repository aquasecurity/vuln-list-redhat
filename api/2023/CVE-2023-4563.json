    "A use-after-free flaw was found in the nftables sub-component due to a race problem between the set GC and transaction in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker to crash the system due to a missing call to `nft_set_elem_mark_busy`, causing double deactivation of the element and possibly leading to a kernel information leak problem."
