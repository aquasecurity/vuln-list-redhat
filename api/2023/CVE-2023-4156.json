  "statement": "This issue is classified with a low severity primarily because this out-of-bounds read is only triggered during the parsing of a specially crafted file, requiring an attacker to convince a user to process this file with gawk. Additionally, the loss of confidentiality is limited and does not represent the real impact of this flaw. Furthermore, gawk does not handle privileged operations, meaning that exploitation is unlikely to lead to system compromise or escalation of privileges. Also, the impact is limited to the application itself, without affecting the broader system or network security.",
