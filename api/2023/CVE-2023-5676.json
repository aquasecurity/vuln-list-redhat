    "Eclipse OpenJ9 is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a flaw when a shutdown signal (SIGTERM, SIGINT or SIGHUP) is received before the JVM has finished initializing. By sending a specially crafted request, a local authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause an infinite busy hang on a spinlock or a segmentation fault."
