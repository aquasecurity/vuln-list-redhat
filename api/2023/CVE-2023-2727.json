  "mitigation": "This issue can be mitigated by applying the patch provided for the kube-apiserver component. This patch prevents ephemeral containers from using an image that is restricted by ImagePolicyWebhook. \nNote: Validation webhooks, (such as Gatekeeper \u003chttps://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper-library/website/validation/allowedrepos\u003e \nand Kyverno \u003chttps://kyverno.io/policies/other/allowed-image-repos/allowed-image-repos/\u003e) can also be used to enforce the same restrictions.",
