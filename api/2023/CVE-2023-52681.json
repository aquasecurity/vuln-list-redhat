    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nefivarfs: Free s_fs_info on unmount\nNow that we allocate a s_fs_info struct on fs context creation, we\nshould ensure that we free it again when the superblock goes away.",
    "A flaw was found in the efivarfs filesystem in the Linux kernel, where s_fs_info is not properly freed upon unmounting. This oversight can lead to a use-after-free condition, which could be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a system crash."
