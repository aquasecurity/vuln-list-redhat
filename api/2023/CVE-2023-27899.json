  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Jenkins 2.393 and earlier, LTS 2.375.3 and earlier creates a temporary file in the default temporary directory with the default permissions for newly created files when uploading a plugin for installation, potentially allowing attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system to read and write the file before it is used, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.",
    "A flaw was found in Jenkins. Jenkins creates a temporary file when a plugin is uploaded from an administrator’s computer. If these permissions are overly permissive, they may allow attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system to read and write the file before it is installed in Jenkins, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution."
