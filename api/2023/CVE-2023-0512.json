Someone who is running untrusted files in script mode is equivalent to someone just taking a random python script and running it.\nSince Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 are Out-of-Support-Scope for Low/Moderate flaws, the issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates for RHEL-6,7. Only Important and Critical severity flaws will be addressed at this time.\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/ and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle \u0026 Updates Policy: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",

  "details": [
    "Divide By Zero in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.1247.",
    "A divide-by-zero flaw was found in Vim's adjust_skipcol() function in the move.c file. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a floating point exception error and causing an application to crash, eventually leading to a denial of service."
