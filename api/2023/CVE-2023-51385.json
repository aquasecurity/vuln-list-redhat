    "In ssh in OpenSSH before 9.6, OS command injection might occur if a user name or host name has shell metacharacters, and this name is referenced by an expansion token in certain situations. For example, an untrusted Git repository can have a submodule with shell metacharacters in a user name or host name.",
    "A flaw was found in OpenSSH. In certain circumstances, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary OS commands by using expansion tokens (e.g., %u, %h) with user names or host names that contain shell metacharacters."
