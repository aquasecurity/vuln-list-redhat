    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nALSA: usb-audio: Fix possible NULL pointer dereference in snd_usb_pcm_has_fixed_rate()\nThe subs function argument may be NULL, so do not use it before the NULL check.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the snd_usb_pcm_has_fixed_rate() function in the Linux Kernel's Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem for USB audio. This issue could allow an attacker with local access and low privileges to manipulate the audio subsystem by interacting with USB audio devices or crafting specific audio-related function calls that pass a NULL pointer to the vulnerable function. This could cause a NULL pointer dereference in the ALSA subsystem, leading to a kernel panic, requiring a system restart to recover."
