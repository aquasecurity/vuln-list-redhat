  "statement": "This vulnerability is considered Important rather than Critical because, while it does allow an authenticated attacker to exploit exposed MBeans (such as the Log4J2 MBean) to write arbitrary files, the exploit path requires prior authentication. The attacker must have valid credentials to access the Jolokia endpoint, limiting the attack's scope to already-compromised or insider-threat scenarios. Additionally, successful exploitation requires specific conditions, such as controlling the file's content in a way that leads to code execution, which is not guaranteed.",

  "details": [
    "Apache ActiveMQ Artemis allows access to diagnostic information and controls through MBeans, which are also exposed through the authenticated Jolokia endpoint. Before version 2.29.0, this also included the Log4J2 MBean. This MBean is not meant for exposure to non-administrative users. This could eventually allow an authenticated attacker to write arbitrary files to the filesystem and indirectly achieve RCE.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.29.0 or later, which fixes the issue.",
