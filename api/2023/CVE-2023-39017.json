    "** DISPUTED ** quartz-jobs 2.3.2 and below was discovered to contain a code injection vulnerability in the component org.quartz.jobs.ee.jms.SendQueueMessageJob.execute. This vulnerability is exploited via passing an unchecked argument. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple parties because it is not plausible that untrusted user input would reach the code location where injection must occur."
