    "A directory traversal problem in the URL decoder of librsvg before 2.56.3 could be used by local or remote attackers to disclose files (on the local filesystem outside of the expected area), as demonstrated by href=\".?../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd\" in an xi:include element.",
    "A directory traversal vulnerability was discovered in the URL decoder of Librsvg. This issue occurs when xinclude href has special characters; demonstrated by href=\".?../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd\" in an xi:include element, which can allow an attacker to send a specially crafted URL request containing \"dot dot\" sequences (/../) to view arbitrary files on the system, affecting the data confidentiality."
