  "details": [
    "libcue provides an API for parsing and extracting data from CUE sheets. Versions 2.2.1 and prior are vulnerable to out-of-bounds array access. A user of the GNOME desktop environment can be exploited by downloading a cue sheet from a malicious webpage. Because the file is saved to `~/Downloads`, it is then automatically scanned by tracker-miners. And because it has a .cue filename extension, tracker-miners use libcue to parse the file. The file exploits the vulnerability in libcue to gain code execution. This issue is patched in version 2.3.0.",
    "A flaw was found in libcue, which is consumed by the tracker-miners application. A user of the GNOME desktop environment can be exploited by downloading a cue sheet from a malicious web page, allowing remote code execution."
