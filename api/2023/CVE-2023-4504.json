  "details": [
    "Due to failure in validating the length provided by an attacker-crafted PPD PostScript document, CUPS and libppd are susceptible to a heap-based buffer overflow and possibly code execution. This issue has been fixed in CUPS version 2.4.7, released in September of 2023.",
    "A vulnerability was found in CUPS and libppd, where a failure to validate the length provided in an attacker-crafted PPD PostScript document can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow, causing a denial of service or, in some cases, execute arbitrary code, depending on how the application processes untrusted PPD files."
