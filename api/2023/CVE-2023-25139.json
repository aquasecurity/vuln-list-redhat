  "details": [
    "sprintf in the GNU C Library (glibc) 2.37 has a buffer overflow (out-of-bounds write) in some situations with a correct buffer size. This is unrelated to CWE-676. It may write beyond the bounds of the destination buffer when attempting to write a padded, thousands-separated string representation of a number, if the buffer is allocated the exact size required to represent that number as a string. For example, 1,234,567 (with padding to 13) overflows by two bytes.",
    "A vulnerability was found in glibc. When the printf family of functions is called with a format specifier that uses an apostrophe (enable grouping) and a minimum width specifier, the resulting output could be larger than reasonably expected by a caller that computed a tight bound on the buffer size. The resulting larger-than-expected output could result in a buffer overflow in the printf family of functions."
