  "details": [
    "Libarchive through 3.6.2 can cause directories to have world-writable permissions. The umask() call inside archive_write_disk_posix.c changes the umask of the whole process for a very short period of time; a race condition with another thread can lead to a permanent umask 0 setting. Such a race condition could lead to implicit directory creation with permissions 0777 (without the sticky bit), which means that any low-privileged local user can delete and rename files inside those directories.",

This issue can cause a race condition in a multi-threaded use of archive_write_disk_header() on posix based systems, which could allow implicit directory creation with permissions 777, without sticky bit, which means any low privileged user on the system can delete and rename files inside those directories."
