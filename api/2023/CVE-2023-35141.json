    "In Jenkins 2.399 and earlier, LTS 2.387.3 and earlier, POST requests are sent in order to load the list of context actions. If part of the URL includes insufficiently escaped user-provided values, a victim may be tricked into sending a POST request to an unexpected endpoint by opening a context menu.",
    "A flaw was found in Jenkins and Jenkins Long-Term Support (LTS), where it could allow a remote, authenticated attacker to bypass security restrictions caused by the inclusion of insufficiently escaped user-provided values in part of the URL. An attacker can send a POST request to an unexpected endpoint by persuading a victim to open a context menu."
