    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ndm thin: make get_first_thin use rcu-safe list first function\nThe documentation in rculist.h explains the absence of list_empty_rcu()\nand cautions programmers against relying on a list_empty() -\u003e\nlist_first() sequence in RCU safe code.  This is because each of these\nfunctions performs its own READ_ONCE() of the list head.  This can lead\nto a situation where the list_empty() sees a valid list entry, but the\nsubsequent list_first() sees a different view of list head state after a\nmodification.\nIn the case of dm-thin, this author had a production box crash from a GP\nfault in the process_deferred_bios path.  This function saw a valid list\nhead in get_first_thin() but when it subsequently dereferenced that and\nturned it into a thin_c, it got the inside of the struct pool, since the\nlist was now empty and referring to itself.  The kernel on which this\noccurred printed both a warning about a refcount_t being saturated, and\na UBSAN error for an out-of-bounds cpuid access in the queued spinlock,\nprior to the fault itself.  When the resulting kdump was examined, it\nwas possible to see another thread patiently waiting in thin_dtr's\nsynchronize_rcu.\nThe thin_dtr call managed to pull the thin_c out of the active thins\nlist (and have it be the last entry in the active_thins list) at just\nthe wrong moment which lead to this crash.\nFortunately, the fix here is straight forward.  Switch get_first_thin()\nfunction to use list_first_or_null_rcu() which performs just a single\nREAD_ONCE() and returns NULL if the list is already empty.\nThis was run against the devicemapper test suite's thin-provisioning\nsuites for delete and suspend and no regressions were observed."
