    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nKVM: arm64: Unconditionally save+flush host FPSIMD/SVE/SME state\nThere are several problems with the way hyp code lazily saves the host's\nFPSIMD/SVE state, including:\n* Host SVE being discarded unexpectedly due to inconsistent\nconfiguration of TIF_SVE and CPACR_ELx.ZEN. This has been seen to\nresult in QEMU crashes where SVE is used by memmove(), as reported by\nEric Auger:\nhttps://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-68997\n* Host SVE state is discarded *after* modification by ptrace, which was an\nunintentional ptrace ABI change introduced with lazy discarding of SVE state.\n* The host FPMR value can be discarded when running a non-protected VM,\nwhere FPMR support is not exposed to a VM, and that VM uses\nFPSIMD/SVE. In these cases the hyp code does not save the host's FPMR\nbefore unbinding the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, leaving a stale\nvalue in memory.\nAvoid these by eagerly saving and \"flushing\" the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME\nstate when loading a vCPU such that KVM does not need to save any of the\nhost's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state. For clarity, fpsimd_kvm_prepare() is\nremoved and the necessary call to fpsimd_save_and_flush_cpu_state() is\nplaced in kvm_arch_vcpu_load_fp(). As 'fpsimd_state' and 'fpmr_ptr'\nshould not be used, they are set to NULL; all uses of these will be\nremoved in subsequent patches.\nHistorical problems go back at least as far as v5.17, e.g. erroneous\nassumptions about TIF_SVE being clear in commit:\n8383741ab2e773a9 (\"KVM: arm64: Get rid of host SVE tracking/saving\")\n... and so this eager save+flush probably needs to be backported to ALL\nstable trees."
