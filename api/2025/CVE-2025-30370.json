  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in jupyterlab-git. On many platforms, a third party can create a Git repository under a name that includes a shell command substitution string in the syntax $(\u003ccommand\u003e). These directory names are allowed in macOS and a majority of Linux distributions. If a user starts jupyter-lab in a parent directory of this inappropriately-named Git repository, opens it, and clicks \"Git \u003e Open Git Repository in Terminal\" from the menu bar, then the injected command \u003ccommand\u003e is run in the user's shell without the user's permission.\nThis issue allows for arbitrary code execution via command injection. A wide range of actions are permitted by this issue, including but not limited to: modifying files, exfiltrating data, halting services, or compromising the server's security rules."
