  "statement": "Red Hat does not ship Keylime 7.12.0 in any supported product, and therefore, this vulnerability does not affect Red Hat customers.\nFor users running third-party installations of Keylime, a flaw exists where strict type checking introduced in 7.12.0 prevents the registrar from processing database entries created by previous versions. This can lead to a denial of service  when agents fail to register after an upgrade.\nRed Hat recommends users refer to upstream Keylime sources for mitigation guidance.",

  "name": "CVE-2025-1057",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in Keylime, a remote attestation solution, where strict type checking introduced in version 7.12.0 prevents the registrar from reading database entries created by previous versions, for example, 7.11.0. Specifically, older versions store agent registration data as bytes, whereas the updated registrar expects str. This issue leads to an exception when processing agent registration requests, causing the agent to fail.",
