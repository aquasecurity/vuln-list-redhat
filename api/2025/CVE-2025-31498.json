  "statement": "This vulnerability is rated as moderate severity rather than important because successful exploitation requires a complex and unlikely set of conditions. While it is a use-after-free bug—typically a serious issue—the ability to trigger it remotely is largely theoretical. An attacker would need to control an upstream DNS server and simultaneously flood the target with ICMP UNREACHABLE packets to influence network behavior precisely, a scenario that is difficult to achieve in practice. Additionally, local exploitation depends on manipulating low-level socket behavior to induce send() or write() failures, which also requires elevated system influence or specific environmental conditions.",

  "name": "CVE-2025-31498",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. From 1.32.3 through 1.34.4, there is a use-after-free in read_answers() when process_answer() may re-enqueue a query either due to a DNS Cookie Failure or when the upstream server does not properly support EDNS, or possibly on TCP queries if the remote closed the connection immediately after a response. If there was an issue trying to put that new transaction on the wire, it would close the connection handle, but read_answers() was still expecting the connection handle to be available to possibly dequeue other responses. In theory a remote attacker might be able to trigger this by flooding the target with ICMP UNREACHABLE packets if they also control the upstream nameserver and can return a result with one of those conditions, this has been untested. Otherwise only a local attacker might be able to change system behavior to make send()/write() return a failure condition. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.34.5.",
    "A flaw was found in c-ares. This vulnerability allows a remote or local attacker to cause a use-after-free, potentially leading to application-level denial of service or other unexpected behavior via manipulation of DNS responses or network conditions during query processing."
