  "details": [
    "A security issue was discovered in  ingress-nginx https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx  where the `auth-url` Ingress annotation can be used to inject configuration into nginx. This can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the ingress-nginx controller, and disclosure of Secrets accessible to the controller. (Note that in the default installation, the controller can access all Secrets cluster-wide.)",
