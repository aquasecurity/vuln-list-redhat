  "statement": "This vulnerability is marked as Important rather than Moderate because it has the potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE), information disclosure, and file corruption under certain conditions. While the exploitation requires specific configurations—such as partial PUT being enabled and writable default servlet—these settings are not uncommon in real-world deployments. The ability to manipulate file storage paths and potentially inject malicious content into sensitive files increases the attack surface significantly. Furthermore, the possibility of leveraging Tomcat's file-based session persistence for deserialization attacks, leading to RCE, elevates the risk level, as it could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in Apache Tomcat. In certain conditions/configurations, this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to exploit a path equivalence flaw to view file system contents and/or add malicious content via a write-enabled Default Servlet in Apache Tomcat. \nFor the vulnerability to be exploited, the following conditions must be true: writes to the default servlet are enabled (disabled by default), sensitive file uploads are sub-directories of a target URL for public uploads, attackers know the names of the files, and those files are subject to partial PUT uploads (enabled by default). If an application uses file-based session persistence with default storage and includes exploitable libraries, remote code execution (RCE) is possible."
