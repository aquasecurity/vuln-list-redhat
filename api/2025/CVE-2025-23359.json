  "statement": "This vulnerability in the NVIDIA container toolkit does not affect Red Hat products.  Specially crafted container images are required for effective exploitation and none of the Red Hat signed containers are crafted in such a way as to allow exploitation.  Our containers which include the nvidia toolkit comply with our operating procedures by utilizing the Container Device Interface (CDI).  As noted in the Nvidia bulletin, the vulnerability does not impact use-cases where CDI is used.\nWeâ€™ve rated this as important vs critical in the event that non-signed container images, crafted by an attacker, are permitted to be deployed in an environment.  This scenario is not typical.",

    "NVIDIA Container Toolkit for Linux contains a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability when used with default configuration, where a crafted container image could gain access to the host file system. A successful exploit of this vulnerability might lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering.",
