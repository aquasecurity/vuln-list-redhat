  "statement": "No Red Hat products are affected by this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability marked as high severity rating rather than a moderate one because it enables a remote, unauthenticated attacker to completely disrupt the availability of the Ollama server by triggering an unchecked null pointer dereference. \nThis flaw allows for a trivial, one-step attack by merely uploading and creating a malicious GGUF model. Given that Ollama is often used in production environments for AI model serving, an attacker can repeatedly exploit this flaw to persistently crash the server, leading to significant downtime, operational disruptions, and potential financial loss. Furthermore, if the crash occurs in a shared or cloud-hosted environment, it could impact multiple users, escalating the overall risk.",
