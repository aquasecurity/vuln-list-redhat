  "statement": "The versions of OpenSSH as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and older, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS are not affected by this vulnerability as the OpenSSH versions distributed with those products are based on previous versions of OpenSSH's version that introduced the issue (openssh-9.5p1 upstream version).\nAlso this issue marked as a moderate severity vulnerability rather than important because, while it enables a pre-authentication denial-of-service (DoS) attack, it does not allow remote code execution, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. \nThe attack is asymmetric in resource consumption, meaning an attacker can force excessive CPU and memory usage, but it still requires repeated connection attempts to sustain the impact. Moreover, OpenSSH provides built-in mitigation mechanisms, such as LoginGraceTime, MaxStartups, and PerSourcePenalties, which can significantly limit the attackâ€™s effectiveness if properly configured.",

  "name": "CVE-2025-26466",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in the OpenSSH package. For each ping packet the SSH server receives, a pong packet is allocated in a memory buffer and stored in a queue of packages. It is only freed when the server/client key exchange has finished. A malicious client may keep sending such packages, leading to an uncontrolled increase in memory consumption on the server side. Consequently, the server may become unavailable, resulting in a denial of service attack."
