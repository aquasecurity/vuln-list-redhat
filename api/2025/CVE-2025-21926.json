  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnet: gso: fix ownership in __udp_gso_segment\nIn __udp_gso_segment the skb destructor is removed before segmenting the\nskb but the socket reference is kept as-is. This is an issue if the\noriginal skb is later orphaned as we can hit the following bug:\nkernel BUG at ./include/linux/skbuff.h:3312!  (skb_orphan)\nRIP: 0010:ip_rcv_core+0x8b2/0xca0\nCall Trace:\nip_rcv+0xab/0x6e0\n__netif_receive_skb_one_core+0x168/0x1b0\nprocess_backlog+0x384/0x1100\n__napi_poll.constprop.0+0xa1/0x370\nnet_rx_action+0x925/0xe50\nThe above can happen following a sequence of events when using\nOpenVSwitch, when an OVS_ACTION_ATTR_USERSPACE action precedes an\nOVS_ACTION_ATTR_OUTPUT action:\n1. OVS_ACTION_ATTR_USERSPACE is handled (in do_execute_actions): the skb\ngoes through queue_gso_packets and then __udp_gso_segment, where its\ndestructor is removed.\n2. The segments' data are copied and sent to userspace.\n3. OVS_ACTION_ATTR_OUTPUT is handled (in do_execute_actions) and the\nsame original skb is sent to its path.\n4. If it later hits skb_orphan, we hit the bug.\nFix this by also removing the reference to the socket in\n__udp_gso_segment."
