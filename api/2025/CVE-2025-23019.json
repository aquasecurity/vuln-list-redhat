  "statement": "This vulnerability is rated as Low impact as it requires a known higher risk configuration. Multiple layers of defaults (packet forwarding and these specific protocols) are disabled by default. Red Hat provides guidance in documentation (linked in references section) on how to configure the system in a more secure manner, which avoids the risk of this vulnerability.",

  "details": [
    "IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling (RFC 4213) allows an attacker to spoof and route traffic via an exposed network interface.",
    "An insecure configuration flaw was found in the IPv4-in-IPv6 and IPv6-in-IPv6 protocols (RFC4213). When configured to not require authentication or filtering, this issue could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to spoof packets or bypass access controls."
