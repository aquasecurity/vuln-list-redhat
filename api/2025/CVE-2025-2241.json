  "mitigation": "A few mechanisms are available to reduce the risks and mitigate this vulnerability:\n1. Restrict Access to ClusterProvision Objects\nEnsure that only trusted users with valid VCenter credentials have read access to ClusterProvision objects.\nThis can be verified using the following commands:\noc adm policy who-can get clusterprovision\noc adm policy who-can read clusterprovision\n2. Rotate VCenter Credentials\nImmediately rotate VCenter credentials to revoke access for any users who may have already accessed the exposed credentials.\n3. Audit VCenter Users and Roles\nConduct a security audit of VCenter accounts and roles to detect any unauthorized access or configuration changes.\nIf any suspicious activity is found, revoke access by rotating credentials again (step 2) and taking necessary remediation actions.",

  "statement": "Hive is an operator which runs as a service for provisioning and perform initial configuration of OpenShift clusters. During this process users are creating instances of hive CRDs and other k8s objects, including a Secret containing credentials where Hive take these inputs and invokes openshift-install to create the spoke cluster. During this process it generations additional objects. One of these objects is an instance of a hive CRD called ClusterProvision. The ClusterProvision object contains unintentionally sensitive information, which may be accessed by unauthorized actors.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in Hive, a component of Multicluster Engine (MCE) and Advanced Cluster Management (ACM). This vulnerability causes VCenter credentials to be exposed in the ClusterProvision object after provisioning a VSphere cluster. Users with read access to ClusterProvision objects can extract sensitive credentials even if they do not have direct access to Kubernetes Secrets. This issue can lead to unauthorized VCenter access, cluster management, and privilege escalation."
