  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in LibreOffice. LibreOffice has a feature where CTRL+click can activate hyperlinks in a document. In Windows systems, the link can be passed to the system ShellExecute function for handling. LibreOffice uses a mechanism to block paths to executable targets to ShellExecute to avoid attempting to launch executables. In affected versions, this mechanism could be bypassed by using non-file URLs that ShellExecute could interpret as Windows file paths."
