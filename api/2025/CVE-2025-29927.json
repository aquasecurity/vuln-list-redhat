  "statement": "This vulnerability is rated as Critical impact, rather than Important, because it allows complete authorization bypass in affected Next.js versions. Attackers can circumvent middleware-based authentication and access protected routes simply by including a specific HTTP header (x-middleware-subrequest). This bypasses all security controls implemented in middleware, granting unauthorized access to sensitive application functionality, including admin panels and restricted resources.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux is not affected by this vulnerability as the authorization functionality of Next.js is not in use and the component is only used at build time.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux AI is not affected since the listed components Pathservice and UI are not provided to the customers.\nRed Hat Trusted Artifact Signer and Streams for Apache Kafka 2 are not affected by this vulnerability as they do not use Next.js for any authorization functionality.",

  "details": [
    "Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Prior to 14.2.25 and 15.2.3, it is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware. If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the x-middleware-subrequest header from reaching your Next.js application. This vulnerability is fixed in 14.2.25 and 15.2.3.",
