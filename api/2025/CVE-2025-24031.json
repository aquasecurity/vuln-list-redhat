  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in the pam_pkcs11 Linux-PAM login module. A segmentation fault condition may be triggered in certain versions when a user presses ctrl-c/ctrl-d when asked for a PIN. When a user does not enter a PIN, `pam_get_pwd` will never initialize the password buffer pointer, and `cleanse` will try to dereference an uninitialized pointer. This issue may lead to an application crash or other unintended behavior."
