    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nsched_ext: Fix pick_task_scx() picking non-queued tasks when it's called without balance()\na6250aa251ea (\"sched_ext: Handle cases where pick_task_scx() is called\nwithout preceding balance_scx()\") added a workaround to handle the cases\nwhere pick_task_scx() is called without prececing balance_scx() which is due\nto a fair class bug where pick_taks_fair() may return NULL after a true\nreturn from balance_fair().\nThe workaround detects when pick_task_scx() is called without preceding\nbalance_scx() and emulates SCX_RQ_BAL_KEEP and triggers kicking to avoid\nstalling. Unfortunately, the workaround code was testing whether @prev was\non SCX to decide whether to keep the task running. This is incorrect as the\ntask may be on SCX but no longer runnable.\nThis could lead to a non-runnable task to be returned from pick_task_scx()\nwhich cause interesting confusions and failures. e.g. A common failure mode\nis the task ending up with (!on_rq \u0026\u0026 on_cpu) state which can cause\npotential wakers to busy loop, which can easily lead to deadlocks.\nFix it by testing whether @prev has SCX_TASK_QUEUED set. This makes\n@prev_on_scx only used in one place. Open code the usage and improve the\ncomment while at it."
