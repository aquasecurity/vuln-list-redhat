  "statement": "The issue only arises when the number of Transmit Queue Pairs (TQPs) exceeds 1024, which may not apply to all hardware configurations or typical use cases. Additionally, the vulnerability triggers an out-of-bounds access in the BAR space during register retrieval operations, such as those invoked by `ethtool`. This means the issue is not to be exploitable remotely, and limited to administrative tasks by privileged users. \nRed Hat Enterprise Linux is not vulnerable to this CVE, as it does not affect the versions or configurations of the Linux kernel used in its distributions.",

    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnet: hns3: fixed hclge_fetch_pf_reg accesses bar space out of bounds issue\nThe TQP BAR space is divided into two segments. TQPs 0-1023 and TQPs\n1024-1279 are in different BAR space addresses. However,\nhclge_fetch_pf_reg does not distinguish the tqp space information when\nreading the tqp space information. When the number of TQPs is greater\nthan 1024, access bar space overwriting occurs.\nThe problem of different segments has been considered during the\ninitialization of tqp.io_base. Therefore, tqp.io_base is directly used\nwhen the queue is read in hclge_fetch_pf_reg.\nThe error message:\nUnable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff800037200000\npc : hclge_fetch_pf_reg+0x138/0x250 [hclge]\nlr : hclge_get_regs+0x84/0x1d0 [hclge]\nCall trace:\nhclge_fetch_pf_reg+0x138/0x250 [hclge]\nhclge_get_regs+0x84/0x1d0 [hclge]\nhns3_get_regs+0x2c/0x50 [hns3]\nethtool_get_regs+0xf4/0x270\ndev_ethtool+0x674/0x8a0\ndev_ioctl+0x270/0x36c\nsock_do_ioctl+0x110/0x2a0\nsock_ioctl+0x2ac/0x530\n__arm64_sys_ioctl+0xa8/0x100\ninvoke_syscall+0x4c/0x124\nel0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x140/0x15c\ndo_el0_svc+0x30/0xd0\nel0_svc+0x1c/0x2c\nel0_sync_handler+0xb0/0xb4\nel0_sync+0x168/0x180"
