  "statement": "This vulnerability is marked as Important severity  rather than Moderate because it allows an unauthenticated attacker to trigger a denial of service  condition by repeatedly sending crafted HTTP requests with low timeouts. The issue leads to a memory leak that cannot be recovered without restarting the application, ultimately resulting in an OutOfMemoryError  and complete service failure.\nIn a production environment, this vulnerability poses a significant risk to availability, especially for applications handling multiple concurrent requests. Since no mitigation exists, all applications using quarkus-resteasy are affected until patched. The ease of exploitation, lack of required privileges, and high impact on service uptime justify the High severity rating.",
