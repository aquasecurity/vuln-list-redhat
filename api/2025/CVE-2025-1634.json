  "statement": "This vulnerability is marked as and Important severity rather than Moderate because it allows an unauthenticated attacker to trigger a denial of service  condition by repeatedly sending crafted HTTP requests with low timeouts. The issue leads to a memory leak that cannot be recovered without restarting the application, ultimately resulting in an OutOfMemoryError  and complete service failure.\nIn a production environment, this vulnerability poses a significant risk to availability, especially for applications handling multiple concurrent requests. Since no mitigation exists, all applications using quarkus-resteasy are affected until patched. The ease of exploitation, lack of required privileges, and high impact on service uptime justify the high severity rating.",

  "name": "CVE-2025-1634",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in the quarkus-resteasy extension, which causes memory leaks when client requests with low timeouts are made. If a client request times out, a buffer is not released correctly, leading to increased memory usage and eventual application crash due to OutOfMemoryError."
