    "Libmodsecurity is one component of the ModSecurity v3 project. The library codebase serves as an interface to ModSecurity Connectors taking in web traffic and applying traditional ModSecurity processing. A bug that exists only in Libmodsecurity3 version 3.0.13 means that, in 3.0.13, Libmodsecurity3 can't decode encoded HTML entities if they contains leading zeroes. Version 3.0.14 contains a fix. No known workarounds are available.",
    "A flaw was found in the ibmodsecurity3 component of the ModSecurity project. Due to an error in handling encoding, ModSecurity cannot decode HTML entities if they contain leading zeroes. This issue may allow malicious payloads to pass through security filters in configurations relying on ModSecurity for web traffic processing."
