  "statement": "This vulnerability is rated as having Moderate impact because it can only be triggered under certain configurations and does not enable complete takeover of the system. In order to be vulnerable, a system using the Apache Camel Framework must specifically be using the camel-bean component as a producer and the exchange is coming from a http-based consumer, such as HTTP component or platform-http. If exploitation occurs, an attacker could call other methods on that bean already in the classpath, but not from other arbitrary java beans, System.getenv, nor part of JDK itself.",

  "details": [
    "Bypass/Injection vulnerability in Apache Camel components under particular conditions.\nThis issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 through \u003c= 4.10.1, from 4.8.0 through \u003c= 4.8.4, from 3.10.0 through \u003c= 3.22.3.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.2 for 4.10.x LTS, 4.8.5 for 4.8.x LTS and 3.22.4 for 3.x releases.\nThis vulnerability is present in Camel's default incoming header filter, that allows an attacker to include Camel specific\nheaders that for some Camel components can alter the behaviours such as the camel-bean component, to call another method\non the bean, than was coded in the application. In the camel-jms component, then a mallicous header can be used to send\nthe message to another queue (on the same broker) than was coded in the application.\nThe attacker would need to inject custom headers, such as HTTP protocols. So if you have Camel applications that are\ndirectly connected to the internet via HTTP, then an attacker could include malicious HTTP headers in the HTTP requests\nthat are send to the Camel application.\nAll the known Camel HTTP component such as camel-servlet, camel-jetty, camel-undertow, camel-platform-http, and camel-netty-http would be vulnerable out of the box.\nIn these conditions an attacker could be able to forge a Camel header name and make the bean component invoking other methods in the same bean.\nIn terms of usage of the default header filter strategy the list of components using that is: \n*  camel-activemq\n*  camel-activemq6\n*  camel-amqp\n*  camel-aws2-sqs\n*  camel-azure-servicebus\n*  camel-cxf-rest\n*  camel-cxf-soap\n*  camel-http\n*  camel-jetty\n*  camel-jms\n*  camel-kafka\n*  camel-knative\n*  camel-mail\n*  camel-nats\n*  camel-netty-http\n*  camel-platform-http\n*  camel-rest\n*  camel-sjms\n*  camel-spring-rabbitmq\n*  camel-stomp\n*  camel-tahu\n*  camel-undertow\n*  camel-xmpp\nThe vulnerability arises due to a bug in the default filtering mechanism that only blocks headers starting with \"Camel\", \"camel\", or \"org.apache.camel.\". \nMitigation: You can easily work around this in your Camel applications by removing the headers in your Camel routes. There are many ways of doing this, also globally or per route. This means you could use the removeHeaders EIP, to filter out anything like \"cAmel, cAMEL\" etc, or in general everything not starting with \"Camel\", \"camel\" or \"org.apache.camel.\".",
    "A vulnerability was found in Apache Camel. This flaw allows an attacker to bypass filtering via a specially crafted request containing a certain combination of upper and lower case characters due to an issue in the default header filtering mechanism, which blocks headers starting with \"Camel\" or \"camel.\""
