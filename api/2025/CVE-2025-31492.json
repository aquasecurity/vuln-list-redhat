  "statement": "This vulnerability marked as important severity rather than moderate due to its direct breach of access control, one of the core pillars of web application security. The flaw allows unauthenticated users to access sensitive protected content simply by triggering a specific OpenID Connect flow, bypassing the intended authentication checks. This is not merely a misconfiguration or theoretical risk â€” it results from a flawed control path in mod_auth_openidc where the module returns OK for unauthenticated requests, and httpd proceeds to serve protected content. The vulnerability affects environments without strict external request validation (e.g., no reverse proxy or WAF), making it highly impactful in real-world deployments.",

  "name": "CVE-2025-31492",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certified authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality. Prior to 2.4.16.11, a bug in a mod_auth_openidc results in disclosure of protected content to unauthenticated users. The conditions for disclosure are an OIDCProviderAuthRequestMethod POST, a valid account, and there mustn't be any application-level gateway (or load balancer etc) protecting the server. When you request a protected resource, the response includes the HTTP status, the HTTP headers, the intended response (the self-submitting form), and the protected resource (with no headers). This is an example of a request for a protected resource, including all the data returned. In the case where mod_auth_openidc returns a form, it has to return OK from check_userid so as not to go down the error path in httpd. This means httpd will try to issue the protected resource. oidc_content_handler is called early, which has the opportunity to prevent the normal output being issued by httpd. oidc_content_handler has a number of checks for when it intervenes, but it doesn't check for this case, so the handler returns DECLINED. Consequently, httpd appends the protected content to the response. The issue has been patched in mod_auth_openidc versions \u003e= 2.4.16.11.",
    "A flaw was found in mod_auth_openidc, an OpenID Connect authentication module for Apache HTTP Server. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to access protected content via crafted HTTP POST requests to protected resources when no application-level gateway is present."
