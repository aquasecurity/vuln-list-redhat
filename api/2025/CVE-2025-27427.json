    "A vulnerability exists in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis whereby a user with the createDurableQueue or createNonDurableQueue permission on an address can augment the routing-type supported by that address even if said user doesn't have the createAddress permission for that particular address. When combined with the send permission and automatic queue creation a user could successfully send a message with a routing-type not supported by the address when that message should actually be rejected on the basis that the user doesn't have permission to change the routing-type of the address.\nThis issue affects Apache ActiveMQ Artemis from 2.0.0 through 2.39.0.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.40.0 which fixes the issue.",
    "A flaw was found in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. This vulnerability allows a user with createDurableQueue or createNonDurableQueue permissions to augment the routing-type of an address without the createAddress permission. When combined with the send permission and automatic queue creation, an attacker could send messages with unsupported routing-types, bypassing intended restrictions."
