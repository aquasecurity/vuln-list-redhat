  "statement": "The use-after-free vulnerability in libxslt marked as a high severity rather than moderate due to its potential impact on system integrity and availability. This flaw arises during nested XPath evaluations where the context node can be modified without proper restoration, leading to use-after-free conditions. Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially causing significant disruptions or unauthorized actions within the affected system.",
