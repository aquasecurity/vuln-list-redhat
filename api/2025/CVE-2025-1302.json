While the vulnerable code is technically still present within Red Hat products, there are no code paths in affected products which allow exploitation. As such, the impact to Red Hat products is low.\nEach of the products listed have multiple components where a fixed build could occur. This distinction does not matter for users as only one build needs fixed for the product. Additionally, in Red Hat OpenShift AI, jsonpath-plus is a dependency of a direct dependency and is never loaded, as the direct dependency's feature that requires jsonpath-plus is not used.",
