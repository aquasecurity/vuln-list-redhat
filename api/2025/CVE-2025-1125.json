  "statement": "To exploit this flaw, an attacker needs to trick a user into running grub2 with a specially crafted HFS file system image, limiting the exposure of this flaw. For this reason, this vulnerability has been rated with a Moderate severity.\nThe grub2 package as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, 8, 9 and in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 is not affected by this vulnerability because the HFS module is not built, so this issue is not applicable.",

  "name": "CVE-2025-1125",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "When reading data from a hfs filesystem, grub's hfs filesystem module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem metadata to calculate the internal buffers size, however it misses to properly check for integer overflows. A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculation to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result the hfsplus_open_compressed_real() function will write past of the internal buffer length. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grub's internal critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution by-passing secure boot protections."
