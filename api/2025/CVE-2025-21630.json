  "details": [
    "[REJECTED CVE] A vulnerability has been identified in the Linux kernel's io_uring subsystem, where the msg_inq field in kmsg-\u003emsg could be used uninitialized during network receive operations. This issue, reported by syzbot, arises when the first submission of a receive request does not successfully retrieve data, and the networking stack fails to initialize msg_inq as expected. An attacker could potentially exploit this flaw to infer previous memory contents, leading to unintended information leakage."
