  "mitigation": "Do not process or load untrusted web content with WebKitGTK.\nIn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, the following packages require WebKitGTK4: evolution-data-server, glade, gnome-boxes, gnome-initial-setup, gnome-online-accounts, gnome-shell, shotwell, sushi and yelp.\nThis vulnerability can only be exploited when these packages are installed in the system and being used via a graphical interface to process untrusted web content, via GNOME for example. In gnome-shell, the vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker from the local network without user interaction.\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, consider removing these packages. Note that some of these packages are required by GNOME, removing them will also remove GNOME and other packages, breaking functionality. However, the server can still be used via the terminal interface.\nAdditionally, WebKitGTK3 is not required by any package. Therefore, it can be removed without consequences or break of functionality.",
