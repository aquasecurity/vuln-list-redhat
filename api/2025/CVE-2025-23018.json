  "statement": "This vulnerability is rated as Low impact as it requires a known higher risk configuration. Multiple layers of defaults (packet forwarding and these specific protocols) are disabled by default. Red Hat provides guidance in documentation (linked in references section) on how to configure the system in a more secure manner, which avoids the risk of this vulnerability.",

  "details": [
    "IPv4-in-IPv6 and IPv6-in-IPv6 tunneling (RFC 2473) do not require the validation or verification of the source of a network packet, allowing an attacker to spoof and route arbitrary traffic via an exposed network interface. This is a similar issue to CVE-2020-10136.",
    "An insecure configuration flaw was found in the IPv4-in-IPv6 and IPv6-in-IPv6 protocols (RFC2473). When configured to not require authentication or filtering, this issue could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to spoof packets or bypass access controls."
