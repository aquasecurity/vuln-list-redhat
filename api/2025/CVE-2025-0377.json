  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "HashiCorpâ€™s go-slug library is vulnerable to a zip-slip style attack when a non-existing user-provided path is extracted from the tar entry.",
    "An archive extraction vulnerability was found in HashiCorp's go-slug library. When go-slug performs an extraction, the filename/extraction path is taken from the tar entry via the `header.Name`. It was discovered that the unpacking step improperly validated paths, potentially leading to path traversal and allowing an attacker to write an arbitrary file during extraction."
