  "statement": "Red Hat does not consider this issue to be a vulnerability. In order to exploit this for cross-site scripting, the attacker would have to get the victim to supply an arbitrary malformed HTTP method to a target site.  However, this has been fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via RHBA-2009:0185 as a bug fix.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x and 2.2.x does not sanitize the HTTP Method specifier header from an HTTP request when it is reflected back in a \"413 Request Entity Too Large\" error message, which might allow cross-site scripting (XSS) style attacks using web client components that can send arbitrary headers in requests, as demonstrated via an HTTP request containing an invalid Content-length value, a similar issue to CVE-2006-3918."
