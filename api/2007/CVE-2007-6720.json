  "details": [
    "libmikmod 3.1.9 through 3.2.0, as used by MikMod, SDL-mixer, and possibly other products, relies on the channel count of the last loaded song, rather than the currently playing song, for certain playback calculations, which allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) by loading multiple songs (aka MOD files) with different numbers of channels."
