    "The Linux kernel 2.6.20 and 2.6.21 does not properly handle an invalid LDT segment selector in %cs (the xcs field) during ptrace single-step operations, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL dereference and OOPS) via certain code that makes ptrace PTRACE_SETREGS and PTRACE_SINGLESTEP requests, related to the TRACE_IRQS_ON function, and possibly related to the arch_ptrace function."
