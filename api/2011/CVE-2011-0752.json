No trust boundary is crossed.\nThis issue did not affect the versions of PHP as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, or 5 (php). This issue was addressed in the php53 packages as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 before their first release in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6, and it was addressed in the php package in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via RHBA-2011:0615.",

  "details": [
    "The extract function in PHP before 5.2.15 does not prevent use of the EXTR_OVERWRITE parameter to overwrite (1) the GLOBALS superglobal array and (2) the this variable, which allows context-dependent attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by modifying data structures that were not intended to depend on external input, a related issue to CVE-2005-2691 and CVE-2006-3758."
