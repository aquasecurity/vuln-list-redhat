  "statement": "This issue did not affect the Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they did not have the vulnerable code as introduced in history:1a7bc914. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0007.html. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is now in Production 3 of the maintenance life-cycle, https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/, therefore the fix for this issue is not currently planned to be included in the future updates.",
