  "statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they did not provide support for the Hierarchical File System (HFS). This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1479.html. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is now in Production 3 of the maintenance life-cycle, https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/, therefore the fix for this issue is not currently planned to be included in the future updates.",

  "details": [
    "The hfs_find_init function in the Linux kernel 2.6 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and Oops) by mounting an HFS file system with a malformed MDB extent record."
