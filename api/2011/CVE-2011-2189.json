  "statement": "This did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 as they did not include support for Network Namespaces. A future kernel update in Red Hat Enterprise MRG may address this issue. The risks associated with fixing this flaw outweigh the benefits of the fix, therefore Red Hat does not plan to fix this flaw in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "net/core/net_namespace.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.32 and earlier does not properly handle a high rate of creation and cleanup of network namespaces, which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via requests to a daemon that requires a separate namespace per connection, as demonstrated by vsftpd."
