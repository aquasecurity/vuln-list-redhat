  "statement": "This issue did not affect the version of vino as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 or 5 as they did not include support for Universal Plug and Play (UPnP).  A future update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.  To mitigate this issue, users should ensure that confirmation is requested on each inbound connection attempt, that a password is required to connect, and that automatic network configuration is disabled.  This will prevent vino from using UPnP to allow access to the VNC port, and will ensure that any connections require a password and that the user is notified on any connection attempts.",

  "name": "CVE-2011-1165",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Vino, possibly before 3.2, does not properly document that it opens ports in UPnP routers when the \"Configure network to automatically accept connections\" setting is enabled, which might make it easier for remote attackers to perform further attacks."
