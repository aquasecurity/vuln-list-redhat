  "mitigation": "For users that do not run applications that use DCCP, you can prevent the dccp\nmodule from being loaded by adding the following entry to the end of the\n/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist file:\nblacklist dccp\nThis way, the dccp module cannot be loaded accidentally, which may occur if an\napplication that requires DCCP is started. A reboot is not necessary for this\nchange to take effect but do make sure the module is not loaded in the first\nplace. You can verify that by running:\nlsmod | grep dccp\nYou may also consider removing the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability from the current\nglobal capability set to prevent kernel modules from being loaded or unloaded.\nThe CAP_SYS_MODULE has a capability number of 16 (see linux/capability.h). The\ndefault value has all the bits set. To remove this capability, you have to\nclear the 16th bit of the default 32-bit value, e.g. 0xffffff ^ (1 \u003c\u003c 16):\necho 0xFFFEFFFF \u003e /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound",
