  "details": [
    "A vulnerability was found in dnsmasq before version 2.81, where the memory leak allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via vectors involving DHCP response creation.",
    "A flaw was found in the Dnsmasq application where a remote attacker can trigger a memory leak by sending specially crafted DHCP responses to the server. A successful attack is dependent on a specific configuration regarding the domain name set into the dnsmasq.conf file. Over time, the memory leak may cause the process to run out of memory and terminate, causing a denial of service."
