    "OpenStack Keystone 15.0.0 and 16.0.0 is affected by Data Leakage in the list credentials API. Any user with a role on a project is able to list any credentials with the /v3/credentials API when enforce_scope is false. Users with a role on a project are able to view any other users' credentials, which could (for example) leak sign-on information for Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP). Deployments with enforce_scope set to false are affected. (There will be a slight performance impact for the list credentials API once this issue is fixed.)",
    "A disclosure vulnerability was found in openstack-keystone's credentials API. Users with a project role are able to list any credentials with the /v3/credentials API when enforce_scope is false. Information for time-based one time passwords (TOTP) may also be disclosed. Deployments running keystone with enforce_scope set to false are also affected. There will be a slight performance impact for the list credentials API once this issue is fixed."
