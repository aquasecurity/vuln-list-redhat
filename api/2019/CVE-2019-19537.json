  "mitigation": "Many Character devices can trigger this flaw as they leverage the lower levels of the USB subsystem.\nThe safest method that I have found would be to disable USB ports that are able to be attacked\nusing this method, disable them first by disallowing them from waking up from low-power states \nwith the command (Replace X with the port number available).\necho disabled \u003e\u003e /sys/bus/usb/devices/usbX/power/wakeup \nThe system must also disable the specific ports power after with the command:\necho suspend | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/devices/usbX/power/level\nThis change not persist through system reboots and must be applied at each reboot to be effective.",
