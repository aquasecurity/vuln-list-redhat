  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In Libgcrypt 1.8.4, the C implementation of AES is vulnerable to a flush-and-reload side-channel attack because physical addresses are available to other processes. (The C implementation is used on platforms where an assembly-language implementation is unavailable.) NOTE: the vendor's position is that the issue report cannot be validated because there is no description of an attack",
    "[Disputed] A vulnerability has been identified in Libgcrypt due to a flaw in its C implementation of AES. This vulnerability enables a remote attacker to perform a flush-and-reload side-channel attack, potentially accessing sensitive information. The vulnerability arises from the availability of physical addresses to other processes, particularly on platforms lacking an assembly-language implementation."
