  "details": [
    "Apache Struts 2.0.0 to 2.5.20 forced double OGNL evaluation, when evaluated on raw user input in tag attributes, may lead to remote code execution.",
    "A flaw was found in Apache Struts frameworks. When forced, struts2 performs double evaluation of attributes' values assigned to certain tags attributes such as ID so it is possible to pass a value that will be evaluated again when a tag's attributes will be rendered. With a carefully crafted request, this can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The largest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
