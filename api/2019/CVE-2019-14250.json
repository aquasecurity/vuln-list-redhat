This flaws affects binutils versions as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 and 8 and also gcc versions as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 ,7 and 8. Versions of gcc shipped with Red Hat Developers Tool Set 7 and 8 are also affected. \nRed Hat Product Security scored the impact of this bug to \"Low\" for the following reasons:\n1. This flaw requires the attacker to attacker to convince a local user to run a specially crafted ELF binary.\n2. The local user must have access to a vulnerable application that incorporates a vulnerable version of libiberty, a part of gnuutils.",
